# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince’s daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman. 

<sup>2</sup> Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies. 

<sup>3</sup> Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins. 

<sup>4</sup> Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus. 

<sup>5</sup> Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king is held in the galleries. 

<sup>6</sup> How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! 

<sup>7</sup> This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes. 

<sup>8</sup> I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples; 

<sup>9</sup> And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak. 

<sup>10</sup> ¶ I am my beloved’s, and his desire is toward me. 

<sup>11</sup> Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages. 

<sup>12</sup> Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves. 

<sup>13</sup> The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
