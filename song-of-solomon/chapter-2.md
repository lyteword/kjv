# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys. 

<sup>2</sup> As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. 

<sup>3</sup> As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. 

<sup>4</sup> He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love. 

<sup>5</sup> Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love. 

<sup>6</sup> His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me. 

<sup>7</sup> I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please. 

<sup>8</sup> ¶ The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills. 

<sup>9</sup> My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice. 

<sup>10</sup> My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. 

<sup>11</sup> For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; 

<sup>12</sup> The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; 

<sup>13</sup> The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. 

<sup>14</sup> ¶ O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely. 

<sup>15</sup> Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes. 

<sup>16</sup> ¶ My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies. 

<sup>17</sup> Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.
