# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee. 

<sup>2</sup> My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. 

<sup>3</sup> I *am* my beloved’s, and my beloved *is* mine: he feedeth among the lilies. 

<sup>4</sup> ¶ Thou *art* beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as *an army* with banners. 

<sup>5</sup> Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair *is* as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead. 

<sup>6</sup> Thy teeth *are* as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and *there is* not one barren among them. 

<sup>7</sup> As a piece of a pomegranate *are* thy temples within thy locks. 

<sup>8</sup> There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number. 

<sup>9</sup> My dove, my undefiled is *but* one; she *is* the *only* one of her mother, she *is* the choice *one* of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; *yea*, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her. 

<sup>10</sup> ¶ Who *is* she *that* looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, *and* terrible as *an army* with banners? 

<sup>11</sup> I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, *and* to see whether the vine flourished, *and* the pomegranates budded. 

<sup>12</sup> Or ever I was aware, my soul made me *like* the chariots of Amminadib. 

<sup>13</sup> Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.
