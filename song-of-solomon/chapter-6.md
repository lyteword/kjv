# Song Of Solomon 6 

**¹** Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee. 

**²** My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. 

**³** I *am* my beloved’s, and my beloved *is* mine: he feedeth among the lilies. 

**⁴** ¶ Thou *art* beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as *an army* with banners. 

**⁵** Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair *is* as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead. 

**⁶** Thy teeth *are* as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and *there is* not one barren among them. 

**⁷** As a piece of a pomegranate *are* thy temples within thy locks. 

**⁸** There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number. 

**⁹** My dove, my undefiled is *but* one; she *is* the *only* one of her mother, she *is* the choice *one* of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; *yea*, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her. 

**¹⁰** ¶ Who *is* she *that* looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, *and* terrible as *an army* with banners? 

**¹¹** I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, *and* to see whether the vine flourished, *and* the pomegranates budded. 

**¹²** Or ever I was aware, my soul made me *like* the chariots of Amminadib. 

**¹³** Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.
