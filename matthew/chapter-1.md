# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. 

<sup>2</sup> Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren; 

<sup>3</sup> And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram; 

<sup>4</sup> And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon; 

<sup>5</sup> And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; 

<sup>6</sup> And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias; 

<sup>7</sup> And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; 

<sup>8</sup> And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias; 

<sup>9</sup> And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias; 

<sup>10</sup> And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias; 

<sup>11</sup> And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon: 

<sup>12</sup> And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel; 

<sup>13</sup> And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; 

<sup>14</sup> And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; 

<sup>15</sup> And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; 

<sup>16</sup> And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. 

<sup>17</sup> So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations. 

<sup>18</sup> Â¶ Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. 

<sup>19</sup> Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily. 

<sup>20</sup> But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. 

<sup>21</sup> And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. 

<sup>22</sup> Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, 

<sup>23</sup> Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. 

<sup>24</sup> Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: 

<sup>25</sup> And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.
