# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him: 

<sup>2</sup> And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, 

<sup>3</sup> Blessed *are* the poor in spirit : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven . 

<sup>4</sup> Blessed *are* they that mourn : for they shall be comforted . 

<sup>5</sup> Blessed *are* the meek : for they shall inherit the earth . 

<sup>6</sup> Blessed *are* they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness : for they shall be filled . 

<sup>7</sup> Blessed *are* the merciful : for they shall obtain mercy . 

<sup>8</sup> Blessed *are* the pure in heart : for they shall see God . 

<sup>9</sup> Blessed *are* the peacemakers : for they shall be called the children of God . 

<sup>10</sup> Blessed *are* they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven . 

<sup>11</sup> Blessed are ye , when *men* shall revile you , and persecute *you* , and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely , for my sake . 

<sup>12</sup> Rejoice , and be exceeding glad : for great *is* your reward in heaven : for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you . 

<sup>13</sup> ¶ Ye are the salt of the earth : but if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be salted ? it is thenceforth good for nothing , but to be cast out , and to be trodden under foot of men . 

<sup>14</sup> Ye are the light of the world . A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid . 

<sup>15</sup> Neither do men light a candle , and put it under a bushel , but on a candlestick ; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house . 

<sup>16</sup> Let your light so shine before men , that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father which is in heaven . 

<sup>17</sup> ¶ Think not that I am come to destroy the law , or the prophets : I am not come to destroy , but to fulfil . 

<sup>18</sup> For verily I say unto you , Till heaven and earth pass , one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law , till all be fulfilled . 

<sup>19</sup> Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments , and shall teach men so , he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven : but whosoever shall do and teach *them* , the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven . 

<sup>20</sup> For I say unto you , That except your righteousness shall exceed *the righteousness* of the scribes and Pharisees , ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven . 

<sup>21</sup> ¶ Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time , Thou shalt not kill ; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment : 

<sup>22</sup> But I say unto you , That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment : and whosoever shall say to his brother , Raca , shall be in danger of the council : but whosoever shall say , Thou fool , shall be in danger of hell fire . 

<sup>23</sup> Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar , and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee ; 

<sup>24</sup> Leave there thy gift before the altar , and go thy way ; first be reconciled to thy brother , and then come and offer thy gift . 

<sup>25</sup> Agree with thine adversary quickly , whiles thou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison . 

<sup>26</sup> Verily I say unto thee , Thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing . 

<sup>27</sup> ¶ Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time , Thou shalt not commit adultery : 

<sup>28</sup> But I say unto you , That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart . 

<sup>29</sup> And if thy right eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast *it* from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not *that* thy whole body should be cast into hell . 

<sup>30</sup> And if thy right hand offend thee , cut it off , and cast *it* from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not *that* thy whole body should be cast into hell . 

<sup>31</sup> It hath been said , Whosoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorcement : 

<sup>32</sup> But I say unto you , That whosoever shall put away his wife , saving for the cause of fornication , causeth her to commit adultery : and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery . 

<sup>33</sup> ¶ Again , ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time , Thou shalt not forswear thyself , but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths : 

<sup>34</sup> But I say unto you , Swear not at all ; neither by heaven ; for it is God’s throne : 

<sup>35</sup> Nor by the earth ; for it is his footstool : neither by Jerusalem ; for it is the city of the great King . 

<sup>36</sup> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head , because thou canst not make one hair white or black . 

<sup>37</sup> But let your communication be , Yea , yea ; Nay , nay : for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil . 

<sup>38</sup> ¶ Ye have heard that it hath been said , An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth : 

<sup>39</sup> But I say unto you , That ye resist not evil : but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also . 

<sup>40</sup> And if any man will sue thee at the law , and take away thy coat , let him have *thy* cloke also . 

<sup>41</sup> And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile , go with him twain . 

<sup>42</sup> Give to him that asketh thee , and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away . 

<sup>43</sup> ¶ Ye have heard that it hath been said , Thou shalt love thy neighbour , and hate thine enemy . 

<sup>44</sup> But I say unto you , Love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which despitefully use you , and persecute you ; 

<sup>45</sup> That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven : for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good , and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust . 

<sup>46</sup> For if ye love them which love you , what reward have ye ? do not even the publicans the same ? 

<sup>47</sup> And if ye salute your brethren only , what do ye more *than others* ? do not even the publicans so ? 

<sup>48</sup> Be ye therefore perfect , even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect .
