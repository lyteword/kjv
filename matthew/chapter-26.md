# Chapter 26

<sup>1</sup> And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples, 

<sup>2</sup> Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified. 

<sup>3</sup> Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, 

<sup>4</sup> And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him. 

<sup>5</sup> But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people. 

<sup>6</sup> ¶ Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, 

<sup>7</sup> There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. 

<sup>8</sup> But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? 

<sup>9</sup> For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. 

<sup>10</sup> When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. 

<sup>11</sup> For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. 

<sup>12</sup> For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. 

<sup>13</sup> Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. 

<sup>14</sup> ¶ Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, 

<sup>15</sup> And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. 

<sup>16</sup> And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him. 

<sup>17</sup> ¶ Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover? 

<sup>18</sup> And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. 

<sup>19</sup> And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover. 

<sup>20</sup> Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. 

<sup>21</sup> And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. 

<sup>22</sup> And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I? 

<sup>23</sup> And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. 

<sup>24</sup> The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born. 

<sup>25</sup> Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said. 

<sup>26</sup> ¶ And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. 

<sup>27</sup> And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; 

<sup>28</sup> For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. 

<sup>29</sup> But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom. 

<sup>30</sup> And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. 

<sup>31</sup> Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. 

<sup>32</sup> But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. 

<sup>33</sup> Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended. 

<sup>34</sup> Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. 

<sup>35</sup> Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples. 

<sup>36</sup> ¶ Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. 

<sup>37</sup> And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. 

<sup>38</sup> Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. 

<sup>39</sup> And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. 

<sup>40</sup> And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? 

<sup>41</sup> Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. 

<sup>42</sup> He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. 

<sup>43</sup> And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. 

<sup>44</sup> And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. 

<sup>45</sup> Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 

<sup>46</sup> Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me. 

<sup>47</sup> ¶ And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 

<sup>48</sup> Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. 

<sup>49</sup> And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. 

<sup>50</sup> And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. 

<sup>51</sup> And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and smote off his ear. 

<sup>52</sup> Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. 

<sup>53</sup> Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? 

<sup>54</sup> But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? 

<sup>55</sup> In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. 

<sup>56</sup> But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled. 

<sup>57</sup> ¶ And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. 

<sup>58</sup> But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end. 

<sup>59</sup> Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; 

<sup>60</sup> But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses, 

<sup>61</sup> And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. 

<sup>62</sup> And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? 

<sup>63</sup> But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. 

<sup>64</sup> Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. 

<sup>65</sup> Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. 

<sup>66</sup> What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death. 

<sup>67</sup> Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands, 

<sup>68</sup> Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee? 

<sup>69</sup> ¶ Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. 

<sup>70</sup> But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. 

<sup>71</sup> And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. 

<sup>72</sup> And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. 

<sup>73</sup> And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee. 

<sup>74</sup> Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. 

<sup>75</sup> And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
