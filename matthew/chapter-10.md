# Chapter 10

**¹** And when he had called unto *him* his twelve disciples, he gave them power *against* unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. 

**²** Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James *the son* of Zebedee, and John his brother; 

**³** Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James *the son* of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus; 

**⁴** Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. 

**⁵** These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into *any* city of the Samaritans enter ye not:

**⁶** But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

**⁷** And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.

**⁸** Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.

**⁹** Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,

**¹⁰** Nor scrip for *your* journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.

**¹¹** And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.

**¹²** And when ye come into an house, salute it.

**¹³** And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.

**¹⁴** And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.

**¹⁵** Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.

**¹⁶** ¶ Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.

**¹⁷** But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;

**¹⁸** And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.

**¹⁹** But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.

**²⁰** For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.

**²¹** And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against *their* parents, and cause them to be put to death.

**²²** And ye shall be hated of all *men* for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.

**²³** But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.

**²⁴** The disciple is not above *his* master, nor the servant above his lord.

**²⁵** It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more *shall they call* them of his household?

**²⁶** Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.

**²⁷** What I tell you in darkness, *that* speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, *that* preach ye upon the housetops.

**²⁸** And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

**²⁹** Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.

**³⁰** But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

**³¹** Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.

**³²** Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.

**³³** But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.

**³⁴** Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.

**³⁵** For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.

**³⁶** And a man’s foes *shall be* they of his own household.

**³⁷** He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.

**³⁸** And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.

**³⁹** He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.

**⁴⁰** ¶ He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.

**⁴¹** He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.

**⁴²** And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold *water* only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.
