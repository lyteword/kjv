# Matthew 25 

**¹** Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

**²** And five of them were wise, and five *were* foolish.

**³** They that *were* foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:

**⁴** But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.

**⁵** While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.

**⁶** And at mid night there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.

**⁷** Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.

**⁸** And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.

**⁹** But the wise answered, saying, *Not so*; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.

**¹⁰** And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.

**¹¹** Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.

**¹²** But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.

**¹³** Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.

**¹⁴** ¶ For *the kingdom of heaven is* as a man travelling into a far country, *who* called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.

**¹⁵** And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.

**¹⁶** Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made *them* other five talents.

**¹⁷** And likewise he that *had received* two, he also gained other two.

**¹⁸** But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.

**¹⁹** After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.

**²⁰** And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.

**²¹** His lord said unto him, Well done, *thou* good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

**²²** He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.

**²³** His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

**²⁴** Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:

**²⁵** And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, *there* thou hast *that is* thine.

**²⁶** His lord answered and said unto him, *Thou* wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:

**²⁷** Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and *then* at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.

**²⁸** Take therefore the talent from him, and give *it* unto him which hath ten talents.

**²⁹** For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.

**³⁰** And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

**³¹** ¶ When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:

**³²** And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth *his* sheep from the goats:

**³³** And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.

**³⁴** Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:

**³⁵** For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:

**³⁶** Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.

**³⁷** Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed *thee*? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?

**³⁸** When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed *thee*?

**³⁹** Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?

**⁴⁰** And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done *it* unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done *it* unto me.

**⁴¹** Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:

**⁴²** For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:

**⁴³** I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.

**⁴⁴** Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?

**⁴⁵** Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did *it* not to one of the least of these, ye did *it* not to me.

**⁴⁶** And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
