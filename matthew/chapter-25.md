# Chapter 25

<sup>1</sup> Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. 

<sup>2</sup> And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. 

<sup>3</sup> They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: 

<sup>4</sup> But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. 

<sup>5</sup> While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. 

<sup>6</sup> And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. 

<sup>7</sup> Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. 

<sup>8</sup> And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. 

<sup>9</sup> But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. 

<sup>10</sup> And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut. 

<sup>11</sup> Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. 

<sup>12</sup> But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. 

<sup>13</sup> Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh. 

<sup>14</sup> ¶ For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. 

<sup>15</sup> And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. 

<sup>16</sup> Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents. 

<sup>17</sup> And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. 

<sup>18</sup> But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money. 

<sup>19</sup> After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. 

<sup>20</sup> And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. 

<sup>21</sup> His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 

<sup>22</sup> He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. 

<sup>23</sup> His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 

<sup>24</sup> Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed: 

<sup>25</sup> And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine. 

<sup>26</sup> His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed: 

<sup>27</sup> Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. 

<sup>28</sup> Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. 

<sup>29</sup> For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. 

<sup>30</sup> And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 

<sup>31</sup> ¶ When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: 

<sup>32</sup> And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: 

<sup>33</sup> And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. 

<sup>34</sup> Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 

<sup>35</sup> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: 

<sup>36</sup> Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. 

<sup>37</sup> Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? 

<sup>38</sup> When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? 

<sup>39</sup> Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? 

<sup>40</sup> And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. 

<sup>41</sup> Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: 

<sup>42</sup> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: 

<sup>43</sup> I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. 

<sup>44</sup> Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? 

<sup>45</sup> Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. 

<sup>46</sup> And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
