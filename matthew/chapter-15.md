# Matthew 15 

**¹** Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, 

**²** Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. 

**³** But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?

**⁴** For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.

**⁵** But ye say, Whosoever shall say to *his* father or *his* mother, *It is* a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;

**⁶** And honour not his father or his mother, *he shall be free*. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.

**⁷** *Ye* hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,

**⁸** This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with *their* lips; but their heart is far from me.

**⁹** But in vain they do worship me, teaching *for* doctrines the commandments of men.

**¹⁰** ¶ And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:

**¹¹** Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.

**¹²** Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? 

**¹³** But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.

**¹⁴** Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.

**¹⁵** Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable. 

**¹⁶** And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?

**¹⁷** Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?

**¹⁸** But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.

**¹⁹** For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:

**²⁰** These are *the things* which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.

**²¹** ¶ Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. 

**²²** And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, *thou* Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. 

**²³** But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. 

**²⁴** But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

**²⁵** Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. 

**²⁶** But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast *it* to dogs.

**²⁷** And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table. 

**²⁸** Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great *is* thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour. 

**²⁹** And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there. 

**³⁰** And great multitudes came unto him, having with them *those that were* lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them: 

**³¹** Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel. 

**³²** ¶ Then Jesus called his disciples *unto him*, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.

**³³** And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude? 

**³⁴** And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes. 

**³⁵** And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. 

**³⁶** And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake *them*, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. 

**³⁷** And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken *meat* that was left seven baskets full. 

**³⁸** And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children. 

**³⁹** And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.
