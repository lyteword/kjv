# Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. 

<sup>2</sup> And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this *fellow* perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, saying that he himself is Christ a King. 

<sup>3</sup> And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest *it* . 

<sup>4</sup> Then said Pilate to the chief priests and *to* the people, I find no fault in this man. 

<sup>5</sup> And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place. 

<sup>6</sup> When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilæan. 

<sup>7</sup> And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time. 

<sup>8</sup> ¶ And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long *season*, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him. 

<sup>9</sup> Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing. 

<sup>10</sup> And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him. 

<sup>11</sup> And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked *him*, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate. 

<sup>12</sup> ¶ And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves. 

<sup>13</sup> ¶ And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 

<sup>14</sup> Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined *him* before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: 

<sup>15</sup> No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him. 

<sup>16</sup> I will therefore chastise him, and release *him*. 

<sup>17</sup> ( For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.) 

<sup>18</sup> And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this *man*, and release unto us Barabbas: 

<sup>19</sup> ( Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.) 

<sup>20</sup> Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them. 

<sup>21</sup> But they cried, saying, Crucify *him*, crucify him. 

<sup>22</sup> And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let *him* go. 

<sup>23</sup> And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed. 

<sup>24</sup> And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. 

<sup>25</sup> And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will. 

<sup>26</sup> And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear *it* after Jesus. 

<sup>27</sup> ¶ And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him. 

<sup>28</sup> But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem , weep not for me , but weep for yourselves , and for your children . 

<sup>29</sup> For , behold , the days are coming , in the which they shall say , Blessed *are* the barren , and the wombs that never bare , and the paps which never gave suck . 

<sup>30</sup> Then shall they begin to say to the mountains , Fall on us ; and to the hills , Cover us . 

<sup>31</sup> For if they do these things in a green tree , what shall be done in the dry ? 

<sup>32</sup> And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death. 

<sup>33</sup> And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. 

<sup>34</sup> ¶ Then said Jesus, Father , forgive them ; for they know not what they do . And they parted his raiment, and cast lots. 

<sup>35</sup> And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided *him*, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God. 

<sup>36</sup> And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, 

<sup>37</sup> And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. 

<sup>38</sup> And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 

<sup>39</sup> ¶ And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. 

<sup>40</sup> But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? 

<sup>41</sup> And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. 

<sup>42</sup> And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. 

<sup>43</sup> And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee , To day shalt thou be with me in paradise . 

<sup>44</sup> And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. 

<sup>45</sup> And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. 

<sup>46</sup> ¶ And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father , into thy hands I commend my spirit : and having said thus, he gave up the ghost. 

<sup>47</sup> Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. 

<sup>48</sup> And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. 

<sup>49</sup> And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things. 

<sup>50</sup> ¶ And, behold, *there was* a man named Joseph, a counsellor; *and he was* a good man, and a just: 

<sup>51</sup> (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) *he was* of Arimathæa, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God. 

<sup>52</sup> This *man* went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. 

<sup>53</sup> And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid. 

<sup>54</sup> And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. 

<sup>55</sup> And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. 

<sup>56</sup> And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.
