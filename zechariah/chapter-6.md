# Zechariah 6 

**¹** And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains *were* mountains of brass. 

**²** In the first chariot *were* red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; 

**³** And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses. 

**⁴** Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What *are* these, my lord? 

**⁵** And the angel answered and said unto me, These *are* the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. 

**⁶** The black horses which *are* therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country. 

**⁷** And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. 

**⁸** Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country. 

**⁹** ¶ And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

**¹⁰** Take of *them of* the captivity, *even* of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah; 

**¹¹** Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set *them* upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest; 

**¹²** And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name *is* The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD: 

**¹³** Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. 

**¹⁴** And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD. 

**¹⁵** And they *that are* far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. And *this* shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.
