# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Now these *are* the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob. 

<sup>2</sup> Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 

<sup>3</sup> Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, 

<sup>4</sup> Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 

<sup>5</sup> And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt *already*. 

<sup>6</sup> And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation. 

<sup>7</sup> ¶ And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them. 

<sup>8</sup> Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. 

<sup>9</sup> And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel *are* more and mightier than we: 

<sup>10</sup> Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and *so* get them up out of the land. 

<sup>11</sup> Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses. 

<sup>12</sup> But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. 

<sup>13</sup> And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour: 

<sup>14</sup> And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, *was* with rigour. 

<sup>15</sup> ¶ And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one *was* Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: 

<sup>16</sup> And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see *them* upon the stools; if it *be* a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it *be* a daughter, then she shall live. 

<sup>17</sup> But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive. 

<sup>18</sup> And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive? 

<sup>19</sup> And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women *are* not as the Egyptian women; for they *are* lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them. 

<sup>20</sup> Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. 

<sup>21</sup> And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses. 

<sup>22</sup> And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.
