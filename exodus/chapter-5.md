# Exodus 5 

**¹** And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness. 

**²** And Pharaoh said, Who *is* the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go. 

**³** And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword. 

**⁴** And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. 

**⁵** And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now *are* many, and ye make them rest from their burdens. 

**⁶** And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, 

**⁷** Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. 

**⁸** And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish *ought* thereof: for they *be* idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go *and* sacrifice to our God. 

**⁹** Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words. 

**¹⁰** ¶ And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. 

**¹¹** Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished. 

**¹²** So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw. 

**¹³** And the taskmasters hasted *them*, saying, Fulfil your works, *your* daily tasks, as when there was straw. 

**¹⁴** And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, *and* demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore? 

**¹⁵** ¶ Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? 

**¹⁶** There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants *are* beaten; but the fault *is* in thine own people. 

**¹⁷** But he said, Ye *are* idle, *ye are* idle: therefore ye say, Let us go *and* do sacrifice to the LORD. 

**¹⁸** Go therefore now, *and* work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks. 

**¹⁹** And the officers of the children of Israel did see *that* they *were* in evil *case*, after it was said, Ye shall not minish *ought* from your bricks of your daily task. 

**²⁰** ¶ And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: 

**²¹** And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us. 

**²²** And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou *so* evil entreated this people? why *is* it *that* thou hast sent me? 

**²³** For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
