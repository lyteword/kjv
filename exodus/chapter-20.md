# Exodus 20 

**¹** And God spake all these words, saying, 

**²** I *am* the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 

**³** Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 

**⁴** Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness *of any thing* that *is* in heaven above, or that *is* in the earth beneath, or that *is* in the water under the earth: 

**⁵** Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God *am* a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth *generation* of them that hate me; 

**⁶** And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. 

**⁷** Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 

**⁸** Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 

**⁹** Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 

**¹⁰** But the seventh day *is* the sabbath of the LORD thy God: *in it* thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that *is* within thy gates: 

**¹¹** For *in* six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them *is*, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. 

**¹²** ¶ Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. 

**¹³** Thou shalt not kill. 

**¹⁴** Thou shalt not commit adultery. 

**¹⁵** Thou shalt not steal. 

**¹⁶** Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. 

**¹⁷** Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that *is* thy neighbour’s. 

**¹⁸** ¶ And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw *it*, they removed, and stood afar off. 

**¹⁹** And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die. 

**²⁰** And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not. 

**²¹** And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God *was*. 

**²²** ¶ And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. 

**²³** Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold. 

**²⁴** ¶ An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee. 

**²⁵** And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. 

**²⁶** Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.
