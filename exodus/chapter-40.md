# Chapter 40

**¹** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

**²** On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. 

**³** And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail. 

**⁴** And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof. 

**⁵** And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle. 

**⁶** And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. 

**⁷** And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein. 

**⁸** And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate. 

**⁹** And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that *is* therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy. 

**¹⁰** And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy. 

**¹¹** And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it. 

**¹²** And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water. 

**¹³** And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest’s office. 

**¹⁴** And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: 

**¹⁵** And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations. 

**¹⁶** Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he. 

**¹⁷** ¶ And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first *day* of the month, *that* the tabernacle was reared up. 

**¹⁸** And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars. 

**¹⁹** And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses. 

**²⁰** ¶ And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 

**²¹** And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses. 

**²²** ¶ And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail. 

**²³** And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses. 

**²⁴** ¶ And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. 

**²⁵** And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses. 

**²⁶** ¶ And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail: 

**²⁷** And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses. 

**²⁸** ¶ And he set up the hanging *at* the door of the tabernacle. 

**²⁹** And he put the altar of burnt offering *by* the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses. 

**³⁰** ¶ And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash *withal*. 

**³¹** And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat: 

**³²** When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses. 

**³³** And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work. 

**³⁴** ¶ Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 

**³⁵** And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 

**³⁶** And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys: 

**³⁷** But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up. 

**³⁸** For the cloud of the LORD *was* upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
