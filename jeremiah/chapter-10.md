# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel: 

<sup>2</sup> Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them. 

<sup>3</sup> For the customs of the people *are* vain: for *one* cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe. 

<sup>4</sup> They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not. 

<sup>5</sup> They *are* upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also *is it* in them to do good. 

<sup>6</sup> Forasmuch as *there is* none like unto thee, O LORD; thou *art* great, and thy name *is* great in might. 

<sup>7</sup> Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise *men* of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, *there is* none like unto thee. 

<sup>8</sup> But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock *is* a doctrine of vanities. 

<sup>9</sup> Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple *is* their clothing: they *are* all the work of cunning *men*. 

<sup>10</sup> But the LORD *is* the true God, he *is* the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation. 

<sup>11</sup> Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, *even* they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens. 

<sup>12</sup> He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion. 

<sup>13</sup> When he uttereth his voice, *there is* a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures. 

<sup>14</sup> Every man is brutish in *his* knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image *is* falsehood, and *there is* no breath in them. 

<sup>15</sup> They *are* vanity, *and* the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish. 

<sup>16</sup> The portion of Jacob *is* not like them: for he *is* the former of all *things;* and Israel *is* the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts *is* his name. 

<sup>17</sup> ¶ Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress. 

<sup>18</sup> For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find *it so*. 

<sup>19</sup> ¶ Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this *is* a grief, and I must bear it. 

<sup>20</sup> My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they *are* not: *there is* none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains. 

<sup>21</sup> For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered. 

<sup>22</sup> Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, *and* a den of dragons. 

<sup>23</sup> ¶ O LORD, I know that the way of man *is* not in himself: *it is* not in man that walketh to direct his steps. 

<sup>24</sup> O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing. 

<sup>25</sup> Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.
