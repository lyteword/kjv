# Numbers 3 

**¹** These also *are* the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day *that* the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai. 

**²** And these *are* the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 

**³** These *are* the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest’s office. 

**⁴** And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offered strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest’s office in the sight of Aaron their father. 

**⁵** ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

**⁶** Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him. 

**⁷** And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the service of the tabernacle. 

**⁸** And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle. 

**⁹** And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they *are* wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel. 

**¹⁰** And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on their priest’s office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 

**¹¹** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

**¹²** And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall be mine; 

**¹³** Because all the firstborn *are* mine; *for* on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall they be: I *am* the LORD. 

**¹⁴** ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying, 

**¹⁵** Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them. 

**¹⁶** And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as he was commanded. 

**¹⁷** And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. 

**¹⁸** And these *are* the names of the sons of Gershon by their families; Libni, and Shimei. 

**¹⁹** And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel. 

**²⁰** And the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi. These *are* the families of the Levites according to the house of their fathers. 

**²¹** Of Gershon *was* the family of the Libnites, and the family of the Shimites: these *are* the families of the Gershonites. 

**²²** Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, *even* those that were numbered of them *were* seven thousand and five hundred. 

**²³** The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the tabernacle westward. 

**²⁴** And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites *shall be* Eliasaph the son of Lael. 

**²⁵** And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation *shall be* the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, 

**²⁶** And the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door of the court, which *is* by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof. 

**²⁷** ¶ And of Kohath *was* the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites: these *are* the families of the Kohathites. 

**²⁸** In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, *were* eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary. 

**²⁹** The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle southward. 

**³⁰** And the chief of the house of the father of the families of the Kohathites *shall be* Elizaphan the son of Uzziel. 

**³¹** And their charge *shall be* the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service thereof. 

**³²** And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest *shall be* chief over the chief of the Levites, *and have* the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary. 

**³³** ¶ Of Merari *was* the family of the Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites: these *are* the families of Merari. 

**³⁴** And those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, *were* six thousand and two hundred. 

**³⁵** And the chief of the house of the father of the families of Merari *was* Zuriel the son of Abihail: *these* shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle northward. 

**³⁶** And *under* the custody and charge of the sons of Merari *shall be* the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels thereof, and all that serveth thereto, 

**³⁷** And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords. 

**³⁸** ¶ But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east, *even* before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, *shall be* Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 

**³⁹** All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their families, all the males from a month old and upward, *were* twenty and two thousand. 

**⁴⁰** ¶ And the LORD said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names. 

**⁴¹** And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I *am* the LORD) instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel. 

**⁴²** And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of Israel. 

**⁴³** And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen. 

**⁴⁴** ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

**⁴⁵** Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I *am* the LORD. 

**⁴⁶** And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which are more than the Levites; 

**⁴⁷** Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take *them:*(the shekel *is* twenty gerahs:) 

**⁴⁸** And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons. 

**⁴⁹** And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites: 

**⁵⁰** Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money; a thousand three hundred and threescore and five *shekels*, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 

**⁵¹** And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.
