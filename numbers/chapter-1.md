**⁴⁹** Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel: 

**⁵⁰** But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that *belong* to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle. 

**⁵¹** And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 

**⁵²** And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts. 

**⁵³** But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony. 

**⁵⁴** And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.
