# Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan *by* Jericho. 

<sup>2</sup> ¶ And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. 

<sup>3</sup> And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they *were* many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel. 

<sup>4</sup> And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all *that are* round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor *was* king of the Moabites at that time. 

<sup>5</sup> He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which *is* by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me: 

<sup>6</sup> Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they *are* too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, *that* we may smite them, and *that* I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest *is* blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed. 

<sup>7</sup> And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak. 

<sup>8</sup> And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam. 

<sup>9</sup> And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men *are* these with thee? 

<sup>10</sup> And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, *saying*, 

<sup>11</sup> Behold, *there is* a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out. 

<sup>12</sup> And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they *are* blessed. 

<sup>13</sup> And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you. 

<sup>14</sup> And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us. 

<sup>15</sup> ¶ And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they. 

<sup>16</sup> And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me: 

<sup>17</sup> For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people. 

<sup>18</sup> And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more. 

<sup>19</sup> Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more. 

<sup>20</sup> And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, *and* go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do. 

<sup>21</sup> And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab. 

<sup>22</sup> ¶ And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants *were* with him. 

<sup>23</sup> And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way. 

<sup>24</sup> But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall *being* on this side, and a wall on that side. 

<sup>25</sup> And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote her again. 

<sup>26</sup> And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where *was* no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. 

<sup>27</sup> And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff. 

<sup>28</sup> And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times? 

<sup>29</sup> And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee. 

<sup>30</sup> And the ass said unto Balaam, *Am* not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since *I was* thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay. 

<sup>31</sup> Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face. 

<sup>32</sup> And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because *thy* way is perverse before me: 

<sup>33</sup> And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive. 

<sup>34</sup> And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again. 

<sup>35</sup> And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. 

<sup>36</sup> ¶ And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which *is* in the border of Arnon, which *is* in the utmost coast. 

<sup>37</sup> And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour? 

<sup>38</sup> And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak. 

<sup>39</sup> And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth. 

<sup>40</sup> And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that *were* with him. 

<sup>41</sup> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost *part* of the people.
