# Chapter 14

<sup>1</sup> And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night. 

<sup>2</sup> And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness! 

<sup>3</sup> And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt? 

<sup>4</sup> And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt. 

<sup>5</sup> Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. 

<sup>6</sup> ¶ And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, *which were* of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: 

<sup>7</sup> And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, *is* an exceeding good land. 

<sup>8</sup> If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey. 

<sup>9</sup> Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they *are* bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD *is* with us: fear them not. 

<sup>10</sup> But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel. 

<sup>11</sup> ¶ And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them? 

<sup>12</sup> I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they. 

<sup>13</sup> ¶ And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear *it*, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;) 

<sup>14</sup> And they will tell *it* to the inhabitants of this land: *for* they have heard that thou LORD *art* among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and *that* thy cloud standeth over them, and *that* thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night. 

<sup>15</sup> ¶ Now *if* thou shalt kill *all* this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, 

<sup>16</sup> Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness. 

<sup>17</sup> And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, 

<sup>18</sup> The LORD *is* longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing *the guilty*, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth *generation*. 

<sup>19</sup> Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now. 

<sup>20</sup> And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word: 

<sup>21</sup> But *as* truly *as* I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD. 

<sup>22</sup> Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; 

<sup>23</sup> Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it: 

<sup>24</sup> But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it. 

<sup>25</sup> (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To morrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea. 

<sup>26</sup> ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 

<sup>27</sup> How long *shall I bear with* this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me. 

<sup>28</sup> Say unto them, *as* I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: 

<sup>29</sup> Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me, 

<sup>30</sup> Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, *concerning* which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. 

<sup>31</sup> But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised. 

<sup>32</sup> But *as for* you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness. 

<sup>33</sup> And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness. 

<sup>34</sup> After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, *even* forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, *even* forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise. 

<sup>35</sup> I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die. 

<sup>36</sup> And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land, 

<sup>37</sup> Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD. 

<sup>38</sup> But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, *which were* of the men that went to search the land, lived *still*. 

<sup>39</sup> And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly. 

<sup>40</sup> ¶ And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we *be here*, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned. 

<sup>41</sup> And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper. 

<sup>42</sup> Go not up, for the LORD *is* not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies. 

<sup>43</sup> For the Amalekites and the Canaanites *are* there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you. 

<sup>44</sup> But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. 

<sup>45</sup> Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, *even* unto Hormah.
