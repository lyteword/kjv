# James 3 

**¹** My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation. 

**²** For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same *is* a perfect man, *and* able also to bridle the whole body. 

**³** Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body. 

**⁴** Behold also the ships, which though *they be* so great, and *are* driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth. 

**⁵** Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! 

**⁶** And the tongue *is* a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. 

**⁷** For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: 

**⁸** But the tongue can no man tame; *it is* an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. 

**⁹** Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God. 

**¹⁰** Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. 

**¹¹** Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet *water* and bitter? 

**¹²** Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so *can* no fountain both yield salt water and fresh. 

**¹³** Who *is* a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. 

**¹⁴** But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. 

**¹⁵** This wisdom descendeth not from above, but *is* earthly, sensual, devilish. 

**¹⁶** For where envying and strife *is*, there *is* confusion and every evil work. 

**¹⁷** But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, *and* easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. 

**¹⁸** And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.
