# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons. 

<sup>2</sup> For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; 

<sup>3</sup> And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: 

<sup>4</sup> Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts? 

<sup>5</sup> Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? 

<sup>6</sup> But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats? 

<sup>7</sup> Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called? 

<sup>8</sup> If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: 

<sup>9</sup> But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. 

<sup>10</sup> For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. 

<sup>11</sup> For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. 

<sup>12</sup> So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty. 

<sup>13</sup> For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment. 

<sup>14</sup> What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? 

<sup>15</sup> If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, 

<sup>16</sup> And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit? 

<sup>17</sup> Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. 

<sup>18</sup> Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. 

<sup>19</sup> Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. 

<sup>20</sup> But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? 

<sup>21</sup> Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? 

<sup>22</sup> Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? 

<sup>23</sup> And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. 

<sup>24</sup> Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. 

<sup>25</sup> Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way? 

<sup>26</sup> For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
