# Colossians 3 

**¹** If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. 

**²** Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. 

**³** For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. 

**⁴** When Christ, *who is* our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory. 

**⁵** Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: 

**⁶** For which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 

**⁷** In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 

**⁸** But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. 

**⁹** Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; 

**¹⁰** And have put on the new *man*, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: 

**¹¹** Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond *nor* free: but Christ *is* all, and in all. 

**¹²** Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; 

**¹³** Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also *do* ye. 

**¹⁴** And above all these things *put on* charity, which is the bond of perfectness. 

**¹⁵** And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. 

**¹⁶** Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. 

**¹⁷** And what soever ye do in word or deed, *do* all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. 

**¹⁸** Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. 

**¹⁹** Husbands, love *your* wives, and be not bitter against them. 

**²⁰** Children, obey *your* parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord. 

**²¹** Fathers, provoke not your children *to anger*, lest they be discouraged. 

**²²** Servants, obey in all things *your* masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God: 

**²³** And what soever ye do, do *it* heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; 

**²⁴** Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ. 

**²⁵** But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
