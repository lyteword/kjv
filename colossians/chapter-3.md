# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. 

<sup>2</sup> Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. 

<sup>3</sup> For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. 

<sup>4</sup> When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory. 

<sup>5</sup> Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: 

<sup>6</sup> For which thingsâ€™ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 

<sup>7</sup> In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 

<sup>8</sup> But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. 

<sup>9</sup> Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; 

<sup>10</sup> And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: 

<sup>11</sup> Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all. 

<sup>12</sup> Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; 

<sup>13</sup> Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. 

<sup>14</sup> And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. 

<sup>15</sup> And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. 

<sup>16</sup> Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. 

<sup>17</sup> And what soever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. 

<sup>18</sup> Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. 

<sup>19</sup> Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them. 

<sup>20</sup> Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord. 

<sup>21</sup> Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged. 

<sup>22</sup> Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God: 

<sup>23</sup> And what soever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; 

<sup>24</sup> Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ. 

<sup>25</sup> But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
