# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven. 

<sup>2</sup> Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; 

<sup>3</sup> Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds: 

<sup>4</sup> That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. 

<sup>5</sup> Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time. 

<sup>6</sup> Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man. 

<sup>7</sup> All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord: 

<sup>8</sup> Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts; 

<sup>9</sup> With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here. 

<sup>10</sup> Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sisterâ€™s son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;) 

<sup>11</sup> And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me. 

<sup>12</sup> Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. 

<sup>13</sup> For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis. 

<sup>14</sup> Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you. 

<sup>15</sup> Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house. 

<sup>16</sup> And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea. 

<sup>17</sup> And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it. 

<sup>18</sup> The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.
