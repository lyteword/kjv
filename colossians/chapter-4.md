# Colossians 4 

**¹** Masters, give unto *your* servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven. 

**²** Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; 

**³** Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds: 

**⁴** That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. 

**⁵** Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time. 

**⁶** Let your speech *be* alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man. 

**⁷** All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, *who is* a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord: 

**⁸** Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts; 

**⁹** With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is *one* of you. They shall make known unto you all things which *are done* here. 

**¹⁰** Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister’s son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;) 

**¹¹** And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only *are my* fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me. 

**¹²** Epaphras, who is *one* of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. 

**¹³** For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them *that are* in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis. 

**¹⁴** Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you. 

**¹⁵** Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house. 

**¹⁶** And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the *epistle* from Laodicea. 

**¹⁷** And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it. 

**¹⁸** The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace *be* with you. Amen.
