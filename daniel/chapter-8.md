# Daniel 8 

**¹** In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, *even unto* me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first. 

**²** And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I *was* at Shushan *in* the palace, which *is* in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai. 

**³** Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had *two* horns: and the *two* horns *were* high; but one *was* higher than the other, and the higher came up last. 

**⁴** I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither *was there any* that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great. 

**⁵** And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat *had* a notable horn between his eyes. 

**⁶** And he came to the ram that had *two* horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power. 

**⁷** And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. 

**⁸** Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven. 

**⁹** And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant *land*. 

**¹⁰** And it waxed great, *even* to the host of heaven; and it cast down *some* of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. 

**¹¹** Yea, he magnified *himself* even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily *sacrifice* was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. 

**¹²** And an host was given *him* against the daily *sacrifice* by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered. 

**¹³** ¶ Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain *saint* which spake, How long *shall be* the vision *concerning* the daily *sacrifice*, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? 

**¹⁴** And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. 

**¹⁵** ¶ And it came to pass, when I, *even* I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. 

**¹⁶** And I heard a man’s voice between *the banks of* Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this *man* to understand the vision. 

**¹⁷** So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end *shall be* the vision. 

**¹⁸** Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright. 

**¹⁹** And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end *shall be*. 

**²⁰** The ram which thou sawest having *two* horns *are* the kings of Media and Persia. 

**²¹** And the rough goat *is* the king of Grecia: and the great horn that *is* between his eyes *is* the first king. 

**²²** Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power. 

**²³** And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up. 

**²⁴** And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people. 

**²⁵** And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify *himself* in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand. 

**²⁶** And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told *is* true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it *shall be* for many days. 

**²⁷** And I Daniel fainted, and was sick *certain* days; afterward I rose up, and did the king’s business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood *it*.
