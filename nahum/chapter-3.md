# Nahum 3 

**¹** Woe to the bloody city! it *is* all full of lies *and* robbery; the prey departeth not; 

**²** The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots. 

**³** The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and *there is* a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases; and *there is* none end of *their* corpses; they stumble upon their corpses: 

**⁴** Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts. 

**⁵** Behold, I *am* against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame. 

**⁶** And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock. 

**⁷** And it shall come to pass, *that* all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee? 

**⁸** Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, *that had* the waters round about it, whose rampart *was* the sea, *and* her wall *was* from the sea? 

**⁹** Ethiopia and Egypt *were* her strength, and *it was* infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers. 

**¹⁰** Yet *was* she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains. 

**¹¹** Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy. 

**¹²** All thy strong holds *shall be like* fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater. 

**¹³** Behold, thy people in the midst of thee *are* women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars. 

**¹⁴** Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln. 

**¹⁵** There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts. 

**¹⁶** Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and flieth away. 

**¹⁷** Thy crowned *are* as the locusts, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, *but* when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they *are*. 

**¹⁸** Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell *in the dust:* thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth *them*. 

**¹⁹** *There is* no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?
