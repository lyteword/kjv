# 1 Corinthians 3 

**¹** And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, *even* as unto babes in Christ. 

**²** I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able *to bear it*, neither yet now are ye able. 

**³** For ye are yet carnal: for whereas *there is* among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? 

**⁴** For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I *am* of Apollos; are ye not carnal? 

**⁵** Who then is Paul, and who *is* Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? 

**⁶** I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. 

**⁷** So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. 

**⁸** Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. 

**⁹** For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, *ye are* God’s building. 

**¹⁰** According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. 

**¹¹** For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 

**¹²** Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; 

**¹³** Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is. 

**¹⁴** If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. 

**¹⁵** If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. 

**¹⁶** Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and *that* the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? 

**¹⁷** If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which *temple* ye are. 

**¹⁸** Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. 

**¹⁹** For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. 

**²⁰** And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. 

**²¹** Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours; 

**²²** Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; 

**²³** And ye are Christ’s; and Christ *is* God’s.
