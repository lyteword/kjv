# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. 

<sup>2</sup> I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. 

<sup>3</sup> For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? 

<sup>4</sup> For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal? 

<sup>5</sup> Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? 

<sup>6</sup> I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. 

<sup>7</sup> So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. 

<sup>8</sup> Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. 

<sup>9</sup> For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building. 

<sup>10</sup> According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. 

<sup>11</sup> For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 

<sup>12</sup> Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; 

<sup>13</sup> Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is. 

<sup>14</sup> If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. 

<sup>15</sup> If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. 

<sup>16</sup> Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? 

<sup>17</sup> If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. 

<sup>18</sup> Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. 

<sup>19</sup> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. 

<sup>20</sup> And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. 

<sup>21</sup> Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours; 

<sup>22</sup> Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; 

<sup>23</sup> And ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.
