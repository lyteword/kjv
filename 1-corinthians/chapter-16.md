# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. 

<sup>2</sup> Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come. 

<sup>3</sup> And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. 

<sup>4</sup> And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me. 

<sup>5</sup> Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia. 

<sup>6</sup> And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go. 

<sup>7</sup> For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit. 

<sup>8</sup> But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. 

<sup>9</sup> For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries. 

<sup>10</sup> Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do. 

<sup>11</sup> Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren. 

<sup>12</sup> As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time. 

<sup>13</sup> Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. 

<sup>14</sup> Let all your things be done with charity. 

<sup>15</sup> I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,) 

<sup>16</sup> That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth. 

<sup>17</sup> I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied. 

<sup>18</sup> For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such. 

<sup>19</sup> The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. 

<sup>20</sup> All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss. 

<sup>21</sup> The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand. 

<sup>22</sup> If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha. 

<sup>23</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 

<sup>24</sup> My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
