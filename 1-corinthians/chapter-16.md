# Chapter 16

**¹** Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. 

**²** Upon the first *day* of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as *God* hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come. 

**³** And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by *your* letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. 

**⁴** And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me. 

**⁵** Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia. 

**⁶** And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go. 

**⁷** For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit. 

**⁸** But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. 

**⁹** For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and *there are* many adversaries. 

**¹⁰** Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also *do*. 

**¹¹** Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren. 

**¹²** As touching *our* brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time. 

**¹³** Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. 

**¹⁴** Let all your things be done with charity. 

**¹⁵** I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and *that* they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,) 

**¹⁶** That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with *us*, and laboureth. 

**¹⁷** I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied. 

**¹⁸** For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such. 

**¹⁹** The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. 

**²⁰** All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss. 

**²¹** The salutation of *me* Paul with mine own hand. 

**²²** If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha. 

**²³** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ *be* with you. 

**²⁴** My love *be* with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
