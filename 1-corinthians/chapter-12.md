# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. 

<sup>2</sup> Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. 

<sup>3</sup> Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. 

<sup>4</sup> Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 

<sup>5</sup> And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. 

<sup>6</sup> And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. 

<sup>7</sup> But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. 

<sup>8</sup> For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; 

<sup>9</sup> To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; 

<sup>10</sup> To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: 

<sup>11</sup> But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will. 

<sup>12</sup> For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ. 

<sup>13</sup> For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. 

<sup>14</sup> For the body is not one member, but many. 

<sup>15</sup> If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? 

<sup>16</sup> And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? 

<sup>17</sup> If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? 

<sup>18</sup> But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. 

<sup>19</sup> And if they were all one member, where were the body? 

<sup>20</sup> But now are they many members, yet but one body. 

<sup>21</sup> And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. 

<sup>22</sup> Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: 

<sup>23</sup> And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness. 

<sup>24</sup> For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked: 

<sup>25</sup> That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. 

<sup>26</sup> And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it. 

<sup>27</sup> Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. 

<sup>28</sup> And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. 

<sup>29</sup> Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? 

<sup>30</sup> Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? 

<sup>31</sup> But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
