# 1 Corinthians 5 

**¹** It is reported commonly *that there is* fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife. 

**²** And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you. 

**³** For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, *concerning* him that hath so done this deed, 

**⁴** In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

**⁵** To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. 

**⁶** Your glorying *is* not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? 

**⁷** Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: 

**⁸** Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened *bread* of sincerity and truth. 

**⁹** I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators: 

**¹⁰** Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world. 

**¹¹** But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat. 

**¹²** For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within? 

**¹³** But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
