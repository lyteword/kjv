# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord? 

<sup>2</sup> If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord. 

<sup>3</sup> Mine answer to them that do examine me is this, 

<sup>4</sup> Have we not power to eat and to drink? 

<sup>5</sup> Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? 

<sup>6</sup> Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working? 

<sup>7</sup> Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? 

<sup>8</sup> Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also? 

<sup>9</sup> For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? 

<sup>10</sup> Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope. 

<sup>11</sup> If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things? 

<sup>12</sup> If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ. 

<sup>13</sup> Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? 

<sup>14</sup> Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel. 

<sup>15</sup> But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void. 

<sup>16</sup> For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! 

<sup>17</sup> For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me. 

<sup>18</sup> What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel. 

<sup>19</sup> For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more. 

<sup>20</sup> And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; 

<sup>21</sup> To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law. 

<sup>22</sup> To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some. 

<sup>23</sup> And this I do for the gospelâ€™s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you. 

<sup>24</sup> Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. 

<sup>25</sup> And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. 

<sup>26</sup> I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: 

<sup>27</sup> But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.
