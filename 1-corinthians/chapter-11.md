# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ. 

<sup>2</sup> Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you. 

<sup>3</sup> But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. 

<sup>4</sup> Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head. 

<sup>5</sup> But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven. 

<sup>6</sup> For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. 

<sup>7</sup> For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. 

<sup>8</sup> For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. 

<sup>9</sup> Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man. 

<sup>10</sup> For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels. 

<sup>11</sup> Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. 

<sup>12</sup> For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God. 

<sup>13</sup> Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? 

<sup>14</sup> Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? 

<sup>15</sup> But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. 

<sup>16</sup> But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God. 

<sup>17</sup> Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse. 

<sup>18</sup> For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. 

<sup>19</sup> For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you. 

<sup>20</sup> When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord’s supper. 

<sup>21</sup> For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken. 

<sup>22</sup> What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not. 

<sup>23</sup> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: 

<sup>24</sup> And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. 

<sup>25</sup> After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. 

<sup>26</sup> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come. 

<sup>27</sup> Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 

<sup>28</sup> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. 

<sup>29</sup> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body. 

<sup>30</sup> For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. 

<sup>31</sup> For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. 

<sup>32</sup> But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. 

<sup>33</sup> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another. 

<sup>34</sup> And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.
