# Ephesians 6 

**¹** Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. 

**²** Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;) 

**³** That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. 

**⁴** And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. 

**⁵** Servants, be obedient to them that are *your* masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; 

**⁶** Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; 

**⁷** With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: 

**⁸** Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether *he be* bond or free. 

**⁹** And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him. 

**¹⁰** Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. 

**¹¹** Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 

**¹²** For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, agains t the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high *places*. 

**¹³** Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. 

**¹⁴** Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; 

**¹⁵** And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 

**¹⁶** Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 

**¹⁷** And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: 

**¹⁸** Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; 

**¹⁹** And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, 

**²⁰** For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. 

**²¹** But that ye also may know my affairs, *and* how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things: 

**²²** Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and *that* he might comfort your hearts. 

**²³** Peace *be* to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

**²⁴** Grace *be* with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.
