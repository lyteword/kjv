# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, 

<sup>2</sup> If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward: 

<sup>3</sup> How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; ( as I wrote afore in few words, 

<sup>4</sup> Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ) 

<sup>5</sup> Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; 

<sup>6</sup> That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel: 

<sup>7</sup> Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power. 

<sup>8</sup> Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; 

<sup>9</sup> And to make all *men* see what *is* the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: 

<sup>10</sup> To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly *places* might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, 

<sup>11</sup> According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: 

<sup>12</sup> In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. 

<sup>13</sup> Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory. 

<sup>14</sup> For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

<sup>15</sup> Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, 

<sup>16</sup> That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; 

<sup>17</sup> That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, 

<sup>18</sup> May be able to comprehend with all saints what *is* the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; 

<sup>19</sup> And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God. 

<sup>20</sup> Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, 

<sup>21</sup> Unto him *be* glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.
