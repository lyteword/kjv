# Ephesians 5 

**¹** Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; 

**²** And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour. 

**³** But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; 

**⁴** Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. 

**⁵** For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 

**⁶** Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. 

**⁷** Be not ye therefore partakers with them. 

**⁸** For ye were sometimes darkness, but now *are ye* light in the Lord: walk as children of light: 

**⁹** (For the fruit of the Spirit *is* in all goodness and righteousness and truth;) 

**¹⁰** Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. 

**¹¹** And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove *them*. 

**¹²** For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. 

**¹³** But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. 

**¹⁴** Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. 

**¹⁵** See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, 

**¹⁶** Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. 

**¹⁷** Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord *is*. 

**¹⁸** And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; 

**¹⁹** Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; 

**²⁰** Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; 

**²¹** Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. 

**²²** Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. 

**²³** For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. 

**²⁴** Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so *let* the wives *be* to their own husbands in every thing. 

**²⁵** Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; 

**²⁶** That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, 

**²⁷** That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. 

**²⁸** So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. 

**²⁹** For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: 

**³⁰** For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. 

**³¹** For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. 

**³²** This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. 

**³³** Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife *see* that she reverence *her* husband.
