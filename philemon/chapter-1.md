# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, 

<sup>2</sup> And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house: 

<sup>3</sup> Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

<sup>4</sup> I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, 

<sup>5</sup> Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; 

<sup>6</sup> That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>7</sup> For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. 

<sup>8</sup> Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, 

<sup>9</sup> Yet for loveâ€™s sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. 

<sup>10</sup> I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds: 

<sup>11</sup> Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me: 

<sup>12</sup> Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels: 

<sup>13</sup> Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: 

<sup>14</sup> But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly. 

<sup>15</sup> For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever; 

<sup>16</sup> Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord? 

<sup>17</sup> If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. 

<sup>18</sup> If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account; 

<sup>19</sup> I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides. 

<sup>20</sup> Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord. 

<sup>21</sup> Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say. 

<sup>22</sup> But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you. 

<sup>23</sup> There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus; 

<sup>24</sup> Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers. 

<sup>25</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
