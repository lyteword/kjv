# Philemon 1 

**¹** Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy *our* brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, 

**²** And to *our* beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house: 

**³** Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

**⁴** I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, 

**⁵** Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; 

**⁶** That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. 

**⁷** For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. 

**⁸** Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, 

**⁹** Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech *thee*, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. 

**¹⁰** I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds: 

**¹¹** Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me: 

**¹²** Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels: 

**¹³** Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: 

**¹⁴** But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly. 

**¹⁵** For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever; 

**¹⁶** Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord? 

**¹⁷** If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. 

**¹⁸** If he hath wronged thee, or oweth *thee* ought, put that on mine account; 

**¹⁹** I Paul have written *it* with mine own hand, I will repay *it*: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides. 

**²⁰** Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord. 

**²¹** Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say. 

**²²** But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you. 

**²³** There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus; 

**²⁴** Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers. 

**²⁵** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ *be* with your spirit. Amen.
