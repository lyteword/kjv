# Chapter 1

**¹** Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness; 

**²** In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; 

**³** But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour; 

**⁴** To Titus, *mine* own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, *and* peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour. 

**⁵** For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee: 

**⁶** If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. 

**⁷** For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre; 

**⁸** But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate; 

**⁹** Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers. 

**¹⁰** For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision: 

**¹¹** Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake. 

**¹²** One of themselves, *even* a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians *are* alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. 

**¹³** This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; 

**¹⁴** Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth. 

**¹⁵** Unto the pure all things *are* pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving *is* nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled. 

**¹⁶** They profess that they know God; but in works they deny *him*, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
