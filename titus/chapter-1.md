# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness; 

<sup>2</sup> In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; 

<sup>3</sup> But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour; 

<sup>4</sup> To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour. 

<sup>5</sup> For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee: 

<sup>6</sup> If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. 

<sup>7</sup> For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre; 

<sup>8</sup> But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate; 

<sup>9</sup> Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers. 

<sup>10</sup> For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision: 

<sup>11</sup> Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake. 

<sup>12</sup> One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. 

<sup>13</sup> This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; 

<sup>14</sup> Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth. 

<sup>15</sup> Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled. 

<sup>16</sup> They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
