# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, 

<sup>2</sup> To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men. 

<sup>3</sup> For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. 

<sup>4</sup> But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, 

<sup>5</sup> Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; 

<sup>6</sup> Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; 

<sup>7</sup> That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 

<sup>8</sup> This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men. 

<sup>9</sup> But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. 

<sup>10</sup> A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject; 

<sup>11</sup> Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself. 

<sup>12</sup> When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter. 

<sup>13</sup> Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them. 

<sup>14</sup> And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful. 

<sup>15</sup> All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
