# Titus 2 

**¹** But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: 

**²** That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. 

**³** The aged women likewise, that *they be* in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; 

**⁴** That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, 

**⁵** *To be* discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed. 

**⁶** Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded. 

**⁷** In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine *shewing* uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, 

**⁸** Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you. 

**⁹** *Exhort* servants to be obedient unto their own masters, *and* to please *them* well in all *things*; not answering again; 

**¹⁰** Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. 

**¹¹** For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, 

**¹²** Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; 

**¹³** Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; 

**¹⁴** Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. 

**¹⁵** These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
