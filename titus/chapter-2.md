# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: 

<sup>2</sup> That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. 

<sup>3</sup> The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; 

<sup>4</sup> That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, 

<sup>5</sup> To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed. 

<sup>6</sup> Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded. 

<sup>7</sup> In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, 

<sup>8</sup> Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you. 

<sup>9</sup> Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again; 

<sup>10</sup> Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. 

<sup>11</sup> For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, 

<sup>12</sup> Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; 

<sup>13</sup> Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; 

<sup>14</sup> Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. 

<sup>15</sup> These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
