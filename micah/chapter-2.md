# Micah 2 

**¹** Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand. 

**²** And they covet fields, and take *them* by violence; and houses, and take *them* away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage. 

**³** Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time *is* evil. 

**⁴** ¶ In that day shall *one* take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, *and* say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed *it* from me! turning away he hath divided our fields. 

**⁵** Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD. 

**⁶** Prophesy ye not, *say they to them that* prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, *that* they shall not take shame. 

**⁷** ¶ O *thou that art* named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? *are* these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly? 

**⁸** Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war. 

**⁹** The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever. 

**¹⁰** Arise ye, and depart; for this *is* not *your* rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy *you*, even with a sore destruction. 

**¹¹** If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, *saying*, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people. 

**¹²** ¶ I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of *the multitude of* men. 

**¹³** The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.
