# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice. 

<sup>2</sup> Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD’s controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel. 

<sup>3</sup> O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me. 

<sup>4</sup> For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. 

<sup>5</sup> O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD. 

<sup>6</sup> ¶ Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, *and* bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? 

<sup>7</sup> Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, *or* with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn *for* my transgression, the fruit of my body *for* the sin of my soul? 

<sup>8</sup> He hath shewed thee, O man, what *is* good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? 

<sup>9</sup> The LORD’s voice crieth unto the city, and *the man of* wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it. 

<sup>10</sup> ¶ Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure *that is* abominable? 

<sup>11</sup> Shall I count *them* pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights? 

<sup>12</sup> For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue *is* deceitful in their mouth. 

<sup>13</sup> Therefore also will I make *thee* sick in smiting thee, in making *thee* desolate because of thy sins. 

<sup>14</sup> Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down *shall be* in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and *that* which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword. 

<sup>15</sup> Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine. 

<sup>16</sup> ¶ For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.
