# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: 

<sup>2</sup> Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, 

<sup>3</sup> According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: 

<sup>4</sup> Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. 

<sup>5</sup> And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; 

<sup>6</sup> And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; 

<sup>7</sup> And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. 

<sup>8</sup> For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

<sup>9</sup> But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. 

<sup>10</sup> Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: 

<sup>11</sup> For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. 

<sup>12</sup> Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth. 

<sup>13</sup> Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance; 

<sup>14</sup> Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me. 

<sup>15</sup> Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance. 

<sup>16</sup> For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 

<sup>17</sup> For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. 

<sup>18</sup> And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount. 

<sup>19</sup> We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: 

<sup>20</sup> Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. 

<sup>21</sup> For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
