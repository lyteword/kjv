# Chapter 14

<sup>1</sup> O Israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. 

<sup>2</sup> Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips. 

<sup>3</sup> Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy. 

<sup>4</sup> Â¶ I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him. 

<sup>5</sup> I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. 

<sup>6</sup> His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon. 

<sup>7</sup> They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon. 

<sup>8</sup> Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found. 

<sup>9</sup> Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.
