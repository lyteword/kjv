# Hosea 14 

**¹** O Israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. 

**²** Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive *us* graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips. 

**³** Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, *Ye are* our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy. 

**⁴** ¶ I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him. 

**⁵** I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. 

**⁶** His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon. 

**⁷** They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive *as* the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof *shall be* as the wine of Lebanon. 

**⁸** Ephraim *shall say*, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard *him*, and observed him: I *am* like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found. 

**⁹** Who *is* wise, and he shall understand these *things*? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD *are* right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.
