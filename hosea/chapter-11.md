# Hosea 11 

**¹** When Israel *was* a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. 

**²** *As* they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images. 

**³** I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them. 

**⁴** I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them. 

**⁵** ¶ He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return. 

**⁶** And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour *them*, because of their own counsels. 

**⁷** And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt *him*. 

**⁸** How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? *how* shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? *how* shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together. 

**⁹** I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I *am* God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city. 

**¹⁰** They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west. 

**¹¹** They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD. 

**¹²** Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.
