# Hosea 5 

**¹** Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment *is* toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor. 

**²** And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I *have been* a rebuker of them all. 

**³** I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, *and* Israel is defiled. 

**⁴** They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms *is* in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD. 

**⁵** And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them. 

**⁶** They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find *him;* he hath withdrawn himself from them. 

**⁷** They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions. 

**⁸** Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, *and* the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud *at* Beth-aven, after thee, O Benjamin. 

**⁹** Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be. 

**¹⁰** The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: *therefore* I will pour out my wrath upon them like water. 

**¹¹** Ephraim *is* oppressed *and* broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment. 

**¹²** Therefore *will* I *be* unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness. 

**¹³** When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah *saw* his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound. 

**¹⁴** For I *will be* unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, *even* I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue *him*. 

**¹⁵** ¶ I will go *and* return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.
