# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without. 

<sup>2</sup> And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face. 

<sup>3</sup> They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies. 

<sup>4</sup> They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened. 

<sup>5</sup> In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners. 

<sup>6</sup> For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire. 

<sup>7</sup> They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me. 

<sup>8</sup> Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned. 

<sup>9</sup> Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not. 

<sup>10</sup> And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this. 

<sup>11</sup> Â¶ Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria. 

<sup>12</sup> When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard. 

<sup>13</sup> Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me. 

<sup>14</sup> And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me. 

<sup>15</sup> Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me. 

<sup>16</sup> They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.
