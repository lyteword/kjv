# Chapter 7

**¹** When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, *and* the troop of robbers spoileth without. 

**²** And they consider not in their hearts *that* I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face. 

**³** They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies. 

**⁴** They *are* all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, *who* ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened. 

**⁵** In the day of our king the princes have made *him* sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners. 

**⁶** For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire. 

**⁷** They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: *there is* none among them that calleth unto me. 

**⁸** Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned. 

**⁹** Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth *it* not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not. 

**¹⁰** And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this. 

**¹¹** ¶ Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria. 

**¹²** When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard. 

**¹³** Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me. 

**¹⁴** And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, *and* they rebel against me. 

**¹⁵** Though I have bound *and* strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me. 

**¹⁶** They return, *but* not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this *shall be* their derision in the land of Egypt.
