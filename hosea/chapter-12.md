# Chapter 12

**¹** Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt. 

**²** The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him. 

**³** ¶ He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God: 

**⁴** Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him *in* Beth-el, and there he spake with us; 

**⁵** Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD *is* his memorial. 

**⁶** Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually. 

**⁷** ¶ *He is* a merchant, the balances of deceit *are* in his hand: he loveth to oppress. 

**⁸** And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: *in* all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that *were* sin. 

**⁹** And I *that am* the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast. 

**¹⁰** I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets. 

**¹¹** *Is there* iniquity *in* Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars *are* as heaps in the furrows of the fields. 

**¹²** And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept *sheep*. 

**¹³** And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved. 

**¹⁴** Ephraim provoked *him* to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.
