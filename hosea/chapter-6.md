# Chapter 6

**¹** Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. 

**²** After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight. 

**³** Then shall we know, *if* we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter *and* former rain unto the earth. 

**⁴** ¶ O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness *is* as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away. 

**⁵** Therefore have I hewed *them* by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments *are as* the light *that* goeth forth. 

**⁶** For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. 

**⁷** But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me. 

**⁸** Gilead *is* a city of them that work iniquity, *and is* polluted with blood. 

**⁹** And as troops of robbers wait for a man, *so* the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness. 

**¹⁰** I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there *is* the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled. 

**¹¹** Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.
