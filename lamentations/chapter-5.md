# Lamentations 5 

**¹** Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach. 

**²** Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens. 

**³** We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers *are* as widows. 

**⁴** We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us. 

**⁵** Our necks *are* under persecution: we labour, *and* have no rest. 

**⁶** We have given the hand *to* the Egyptians, *and to* the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. 

**⁷** Our fathers have sinned, *and are* not; and we have borne their iniquities. 

**⁸** Servants have ruled over us: *there is* none that doth deliver *us* out of their hand. 

**⁹** We gat our bread with *the peril of* our lives because of the sword of the wilderness. 

**¹⁰** Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine. 

**¹¹** They ravished the women in Zion, *and* the maids in the cities of Judah. 

**¹²** Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured. 

**¹³** They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood. 

**¹⁴** The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick. 

**¹⁵** The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning. 

**¹⁶** The crown is fallen *from* our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned! 

**¹⁷** For this our heart is faint; for these *things* our eyes are dim. 

**¹⁸** Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it. 

**¹⁹** Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation. 

**²⁰** Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, *and* forsake us so long time? 

**²¹** Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old. 

**²²** But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.
