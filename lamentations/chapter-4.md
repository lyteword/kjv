# Chapter 4

**¹** How is the gold become dim! *how* is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street. 

**²** The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter! 

**³** Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people *is become* cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness. 

**⁴** The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, *and* no man breaketh *it* unto them. 

**⁵** They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills. 

**⁶** For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her. 

**⁷** Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing *was* of sapphire: 

**⁸** Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick. 

**⁹** *They that be* slain with the sword are better than *they that be* slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for *want of* the fruits of the field. 

**¹⁰** The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. 

**¹¹** The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof. 

**¹²** The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem. 

**¹³** ¶ For the sins of her prophets, *and* the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her, 

**¹⁴** They have wandered *as* blind *men* in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments. 

**¹⁵** They cried unto them, Depart ye; *it is* unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn *there*. 

**¹⁶** The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders. 

**¹⁷** As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation *that* could not save *us*. 

**¹⁸** They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come. 

**¹⁹** Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness. 

**²⁰** The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen. 

**²¹** ¶ Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked. 

**²²** ¶ The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.
