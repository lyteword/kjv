# Lamentations 3 

**¹** I *am* the man *that* hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. 

**²** He hath led me, and brought *me into* darkness, but not *into* light. 

**³** Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand *against me* all the day. 

**⁴** My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones. 

**⁵** He hath builded against me, and compassed *me* with gall and travail. 

**⁶** He hath set me in dark places, as *they that be* dead of old. 

**⁷** He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy. 

**⁸** Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer. 

**⁹** He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked. 

**¹⁰** He *was* unto me *as* a bear lying in wait, *and as* a lion in secret places. 

**¹¹** He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate. 

**¹²** He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. 

**¹³** He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins. 

**¹⁴** I was a derision to all my people; *and* their song all the day. 

**¹⁵** He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood. 

**¹⁶** He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes. 

**¹⁷** And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity. 

**¹⁸** And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD: 

**¹⁹** Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. 

**²⁰** My soul hath *them* still in remembrance, and is humbled in me. 

**²¹** This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. 

**²²** ¶ *It is of* the LORD’s mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. 

**²³** *They are* new every morning: great *is* thy faithfulness. 

**²⁴** The LORD *is* my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. 

**²⁵** The LORD *is* good unto them that wait for him, to the soul *that* seeketh him. 

**²⁶** *It is* good that *a man* should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD. 

**²⁷** *It is* good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. 

**²⁸** He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne *it* upon him. 

**²⁹** He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope. 

**³⁰** He giveth *his* cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach. 

**³¹** For the Lord will not cast off for ever: 

**³²** But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies. 

**³³** For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. 

**³⁴** To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth, 

**³⁵** To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High, 

**³⁶** To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not. 

**³⁷** ¶ Who *is* he *that* saith, and it cometh to pass, *when* the Lord commandeth *it* not? 

**³⁸** Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good? 

**³⁹** Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? 

**⁴⁰** Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD. 

**⁴¹** Let us lift up our heart with *our* hands unto God in the heavens. 

**⁴²** We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned. 

**⁴³** Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied. 

**⁴⁴** Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that *our* prayer should not pass through. 

**⁴⁵** Thou hast made us *as* the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people. 

**⁴⁶** All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. 

**⁴⁷** Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction. 

**⁴⁸** Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people. 

**⁴⁹** Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission, 

**⁵⁰** Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven. 

**⁵¹** Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city. 

**⁵²** Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause. 

**⁵³** They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me. 

**⁵⁴** Waters flowed over mine head; *then* I said, I am cut off. 

**⁵⁵** ¶ I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon. 

**⁵⁶** Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. 

**⁵⁷** Thou drewest near in the day *that* I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not. 

**⁵⁸** O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life. 

**⁵⁹** O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause. 

**⁶⁰** Thou hast seen all their vengeance *and* all their imaginations against me. 

**⁶¹** Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, *and* all their imaginations against me; 

**⁶²** The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day. 

**⁶³** Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I *am* their musick. 

**⁶⁴** ¶ Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands. 

**⁶⁵** Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them. 

**⁶⁶** Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.
