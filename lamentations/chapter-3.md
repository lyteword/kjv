# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. 

<sup>2</sup> He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light. 

<sup>3</sup> Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the day. 

<sup>4</sup> My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones. 

<sup>5</sup> He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail. 

<sup>6</sup> He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old. 

<sup>7</sup> He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy. 

<sup>8</sup> Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer. 

<sup>9</sup> He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked. 

<sup>10</sup> He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places. 

<sup>11</sup> He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate. 

<sup>12</sup> He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. 

<sup>13</sup> He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins. 

<sup>14</sup> I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day. 

<sup>15</sup> He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood. 

<sup>16</sup> He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes. 

<sup>17</sup> And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity. 

<sup>18</sup> And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD: 

<sup>19</sup> Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. 

<sup>20</sup> My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me. 

<sup>21</sup> This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. 

<sup>22</sup> ¶ It is of the LORD’s mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. 

<sup>23</sup> They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness. 

<sup>24</sup> The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. 

<sup>25</sup> The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him. 

<sup>26</sup> It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD. 

<sup>27</sup> It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. 

<sup>28</sup> He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him. 

<sup>29</sup> He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope. 

<sup>30</sup> He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach. 

<sup>31</sup> For the Lord will not cast off for ever: 

<sup>32</sup> But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies. 

<sup>33</sup> For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. 

<sup>34</sup> To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth, 

<sup>35</sup> To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High, 

<sup>36</sup> To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not. 

<sup>37</sup> ¶ Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not? 

<sup>38</sup> Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good? 

<sup>39</sup> Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? 

<sup>40</sup> Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD. 

<sup>41</sup> Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens. 

<sup>42</sup> We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned. 

<sup>43</sup> Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied. 

<sup>44</sup> Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through. 

<sup>45</sup> Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people. 

<sup>46</sup> All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. 

<sup>47</sup> Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction. 

<sup>48</sup> Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people. 

<sup>49</sup> Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission, 

<sup>50</sup> Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven. 

<sup>51</sup> Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city. 

<sup>52</sup> Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause. 

<sup>53</sup> They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me. 

<sup>54</sup> Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off. 

<sup>55</sup> ¶ I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon. 

<sup>56</sup> Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. 

<sup>57</sup> Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not. 

<sup>58</sup> O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life. 

<sup>59</sup> O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause. 

<sup>60</sup> Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me. 

<sup>61</sup> Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me; 

<sup>62</sup> The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day. 

<sup>63</sup> Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick. 

<sup>64</sup> ¶ Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands. 

<sup>65</sup> Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them. 

<sup>66</sup> Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.
