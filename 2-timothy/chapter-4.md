# Chapter 4

**¹** I charge *thee* therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; 

**²** Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. 

**³** For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; 

**⁴** And they shall turn away *their* ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. 

**⁵** But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. 

**⁶** For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. 

**⁷** I have fought a good fight, I have finished *my* course, I have kept the faith: 

**⁸** Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. 

**⁹** Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me: 

**¹⁰** For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia. 

**¹¹** Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry. 

**¹²** And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus. 

**¹³** The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring *with thee*, and the books, *but* especially the parchments. 

**¹⁴** Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works: 

**¹⁵** Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words. 

**¹⁶** At my first answer no man stood with me, but all *men* forsook me: *I pray God* that it may not be laid to their charge. 

**¹⁷** Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and *that* all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. 

**¹⁸** And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve *me* unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom *be* glory for ever and ever. Amen. 

**¹⁹** Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. 

**²⁰** Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick. 

**²¹** Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren. 

**²²** The Lord Jesus Christ *be* with thy spirit. Grace *be* with you. Amen.
