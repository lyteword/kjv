# 2 Timothy 2 

**¹** Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 

**²** And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. 

**³** Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 

**⁴** No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of *this* life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. 

**⁵** And if a man also strive for masteries, *yet* is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully. 

**⁶** The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits. 

**⁷** Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things. 

**⁸** Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel: 

**⁹** Where in I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, *even* unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound. 

**¹⁰** Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 

**¹¹** *It is* a faithful saying: For if we be dead with *him*, we shall also live with *him*: 

**¹²** If we suffer, we shall also reign with *him*: if we deny *him*, he also will deny us: 

**¹³** If we believe not, *yet* he abideth faithful: he can not deny himself. 

**¹⁴** Of these things put *them* in remembrance, charging *them* before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, *but* to the subverting of the hearers. 

**¹⁵** Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 

**¹⁶** But shun profane *and* vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness. 

**¹⁷** And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; 

**¹⁸** Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. 

**¹⁹** Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. 

**²⁰** But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. 

**²¹** If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, *and* prepared unto every good work. 

**²²** Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 

**²³** But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. 

**²⁴** And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all *men*, apt to teach, patient, 

**²⁵** In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; 

**²⁶** And *that* they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.
