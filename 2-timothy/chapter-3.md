# Chapter 3

**¹** This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. 

**²** For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 

**³** Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, 

**⁴** Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; 

**⁵** Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. 

**⁶** For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, 

**⁷** Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 

**⁸** Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 

**⁹** But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all *men*, as theirs also was. 

**¹⁰** But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, 

**¹¹** Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of *them* all the Lord delivered me. 

**¹²** Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. 

**¹³** But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. 

**¹⁴** But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned *them*; 

**¹⁵** And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 

**¹⁶** All scripture *is* given by inspiration of God, and *is* profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: 

**¹⁷** That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.
