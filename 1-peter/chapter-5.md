# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: 

<sup>2</sup> Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight *thereof*, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; 

<sup>3</sup> Neither as being lords over *God’s* heritage, but being ensamples to the flock. 

<sup>4</sup> And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. 

<sup>5</sup> Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all *of you* be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. 

<sup>6</sup> Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: 

<sup>7</sup> Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. 

<sup>8</sup> Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: 

<sup>9</sup> Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. 

<sup>10</sup> But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle *you*. 

<sup>11</sup> To him *be* glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 

<sup>12</sup> By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand. 

<sup>13</sup> The *church that is* at Babylon, elected together with *you*, saluteth you; and *so doth* Marcus my son. 

<sup>14</sup> Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace *be* with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
