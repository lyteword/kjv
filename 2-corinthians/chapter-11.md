# 2 Corinthians 11 

**¹** Would to God ye could bear with me a little in *my* folly: and indeed bear with me. 

**²** For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present *you as* a chaste virgin to Christ. 

**³** But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. 

**⁴** For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or *if* ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with *him*. 

**⁵** For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. 

**⁶** But though *I be* rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things. 

**⁷** Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely? 

**⁸** I robbed other churches, taking wages *of them*, to do you service. 

**⁹** And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all *things* I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and *so* will I keep *myself*. 

**¹⁰** As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia. 

**¹¹** Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth. 

**¹²** But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. 

**¹³** For such *are* false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. 

**¹⁴** And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. 

**¹⁵** Therefore *it is* no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works. 

**¹⁶** I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little. 

**¹⁷** That which I speak, I speak *it* not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. 

**¹⁸** Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. 

**¹⁹** For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye *yourselves* are wise. 

**²⁰** For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour *you*, if a man take *of you*, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face. 

**²¹** I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also. 

**²²** Are they Hebrews? so *am* I. Are they Israelites? so *am* I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so *am* I. 

**²³** Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I *am* more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. 

**²⁴** Of the Jews five times received I forty *stripes* save one. 

**²⁵** Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; 

**²⁶** *In* journeyings often, *in* perils of waters, *in* perils of robbers, *in* perils by *mine own* countrymen, *in* perils by the heathen, *in* perils in the city, *in* perils in the wilderness, *in* perils in the sea, *in* perils among false brethren; 

**²⁷** In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. 

**²⁸** Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches. 

**²⁹** Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? 

**³⁰** If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities. 

**³¹** The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not. 

**³²** In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me: 

**³³** And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.
