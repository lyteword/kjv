# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> For we know that if our earthly house of *this* tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. 

<sup>2</sup> For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: 

<sup>3</sup> If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. 

<sup>4</sup> For we that are in *this* tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life. 

<sup>5</sup> Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing *is* God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. 

<sup>6</sup> Therefore *we are* always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: 

<sup>7</sup> (For we walk by faith, not by sight:) 

<sup>8</sup> We are confident, *I say*, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord. 

<sup>9</sup> Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. 

<sup>10</sup> For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things *done* in *his* body, according to that he hath done, whether *it be* good or bad. 

<sup>11</sup> Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences. 

<sup>12</sup> For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to *answer* them which glory in appearance, and not in heart. 

<sup>13</sup> For whether we be beside ourselves, *it is* to God: or whether we be sober, *it is* for your cause. 

<sup>14</sup> For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: 

<sup>15</sup> And *that* he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. 

<sup>16</sup> Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we *him* no more. 

<sup>17</sup> Therefore if any man *be* in Christ, *he is* a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. 

<sup>18</sup> And all things *are* of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; 

<sup>19</sup> To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. 

<sup>20</sup> Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech *you* by us: we pray *you* in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God. 

<sup>21</sup> For he hath made him *to be* sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
