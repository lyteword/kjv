# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness. 

<sup>2</sup> For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me? 

<sup>3</sup> And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all. 

<sup>4</sup> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you. 

<sup>5</sup> But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all. 

<sup>6</sup> Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many. 

<sup>7</sup> So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. 

<sup>8</sup> Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him. 

<sup>9</sup> For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things. 

<sup>10</sup> To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ; 

<sup>11</sup> Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices. 

<sup>12</sup> Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ’s gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord, 

<sup>13</sup> I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia. 

<sup>14</sup> Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. 

<sup>15</sup> For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: 

<sup>16</sup> To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things? 

<sup>17</sup> For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.
