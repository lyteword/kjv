# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write ; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God , and the seven stars ; I know thy works , that thou hast a name that thou livest , and art dead . 

<sup>2</sup> Be watchful , and strengthen the things which remain , that are ready to die : for I have not found thy works perfect before God . 

<sup>3</sup> Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard , and hold fast , and repent . If therefore thou shalt not watch , I will come on thee as a thief , and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee . 

<sup>4</sup> Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments ; and they shall walk with me in white : for they are worthy . 

<sup>5</sup> He that overcometh , the same shall be clothed in white raiment ; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life , but I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels . 

<sup>6</sup> He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches . 

<sup>7</sup> And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write ; These things saith he that is holy , he that is true , he that hath the key of David , he that openeth , and no man shutteth ; and shutteth , and no man openeth ; 

<sup>8</sup> I know thy works : behold , I have set before thee an open door , and no man can shut it : for thou hast a little strength , and hast kept my word , and hast not denied my name . 

<sup>9</sup> Behold , I will make them of the synagogue of Satan , which say they are Jews , and are not , but do lie ; behold , I will make them to come and worship before thy feet , and to know that I have loved thee . 

<sup>10</sup> Because thou hast kept the word of my patience , I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation , which shall come upon all the world , to try them that dwell upon the earth . 

<sup>11</sup> Behold , I come quickly : hold that fast which thou hast , that no man take thy crown . 

<sup>12</sup> Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God , and he shall go no more out : and I will write upon him the name of my God , and the name of the city of my God , *which is* new Jerusalem , which cometh down out of heaven from my God : and *I will write upon him* my new name . 

<sup>13</sup> He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches . 

<sup>14</sup> And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write ; These things saith the Amen , the faithful and true witness , the beginning of the creation of God ; 

<sup>15</sup> I know thy works , that thou art neither cold nor hot : I would thou wert cold or hot . 

<sup>16</sup> So then because thou art lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , I will spue thee out of my mouth . 

<sup>17</sup> Because thou sayest , I am rich , and increased with goods , and have need of nothing ; and knowest not that thou art wretched , and miserable , and poor , and blind , and naked : 

<sup>18</sup> I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire , that thou mayest be rich ; and white raiment , that thou mayest be clothed , and *that* the shame of thy nakedness do not appear ; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve , that thou mayest see . 

<sup>19</sup> As many as I love , I rebuke and chasten : be zealous therefore , and repent . 

<sup>20</sup> Behold , I stand at the door , and knock : if any man hear my voice , and open the door , I will come in to him , and will sup with him , and he with me . 

<sup>21</sup> To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne , even as I also overcame , and am set down with my Father in his throne . 

<sup>22</sup> He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
