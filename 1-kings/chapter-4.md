# Chapter 4

**¹** So king Solomon was king over all Israel. 

**²** And these *were* the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest, 

**³** Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder. 

**⁴** And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada *was* over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar *were* the priests: 

**⁵** And Azariah the son of Nathan *was* over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan *was* principal officer, *and* the king’s friend: 

**⁶** And Ahishar *was* over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda *was* over the tribute. 

**⁷** ¶ And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision. 

**⁸** And these *are* their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim: 

**⁹** The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan: 

**¹⁰** The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him *pertained* Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher: 

**¹¹** The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife: 

**¹²** Baana the son of Ahilud; *to him pertained* Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which *is* by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, *even* unto *the place that is* beyond Jokneam: 

**¹³** The son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him *pertained* the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which *are* in Gilead; to him *also pertained* the region of Argob, which *is* in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars: 

**¹⁴** Ahinadab the son of Iddo *had* Mahanaim: 

**¹⁵** Ahimaaz *was* in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife: 

**¹⁶** Baanah the son of Hushai *was* in Asher and in Aloth: 

**¹⁷** Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar: 

**¹⁸** Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin: 

**¹⁹** Geber the son of Uri *was* in the country of Gilead, *in* the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and *he was* the only officer which *was* in the land. 

**²⁰** ¶ Judah and Israel *were* many, as the sand which *is* by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry. 

**²¹** And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life. 

**²²** ¶ And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, 

**²³** Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl. 

**²⁴** For he had dominion over all *the region* on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him. 

**²⁵** And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon. 

**²⁶** ¶ And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. 

**²⁷** And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing. 

**²⁸** Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where *the officers* were, every man according to his charge. 

**²⁹** ¶ And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that *is* on the sea shore. 

**³⁰** And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. 

**³¹** For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about. 

**³²** And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. 

**³³** And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that *is* in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. 

**³⁴** And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.
