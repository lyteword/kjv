# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> So king Solomon was king over all Israel. 

<sup>2</sup> And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest, 

<sup>3</sup> Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder. 

<sup>4</sup> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests: 

<sup>5</sup> And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king’s friend: 

<sup>6</sup> And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute. 

<sup>7</sup> ¶ And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision. 

<sup>8</sup> And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim: 

<sup>9</sup> The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan: 

<sup>10</sup> The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher: 

<sup>11</sup> The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife: 

<sup>12</sup> Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam: 

<sup>13</sup> The son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars: 

<sup>14</sup> Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim: 

<sup>15</sup> Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife: 

<sup>16</sup> Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth: 

<sup>17</sup> Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar: 

<sup>18</sup> Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin: 

<sup>19</sup> Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land. 

<sup>20</sup> ¶ Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry. 

<sup>21</sup> And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life. 

<sup>22</sup> ¶ And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, 

<sup>23</sup> Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl. 

<sup>24</sup> For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him. 

<sup>25</sup> And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon. 

<sup>26</sup> ¶ And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. 

<sup>27</sup> And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing. 

<sup>28</sup> Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge. 

<sup>29</sup> ¶ And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore. 

<sup>30</sup> And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. 

<sup>31</sup> For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about. 

<sup>32</sup> And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. 

<sup>33</sup> And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. 

<sup>34</sup> And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.
