# Chapter 27

<sup>1</sup> The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 

<sup>2</sup> Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus; 

<sup>3</sup> And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, *which art* a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I *am* of perfect beauty. 

<sup>4</sup> Thy borders *are* in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty. 

<sup>5</sup> They have made all thy *ship* boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee. 

<sup>6</sup> *Of* the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches *of* ivory, *brought* out of the isles of Chittim. 

<sup>7</sup> Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee. 

<sup>8</sup> The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise *men*, O Tyrus, *that* were in thee, were thy pilots. 

<sup>9</sup> The ancients of Gebal and the wise *men* thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise. 

<sup>10</sup> They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness. 

<sup>11</sup> The men of Arvad with thine army *were* upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect. 

<sup>12</sup> Tarshish *was* thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all *kind of* riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs. 

<sup>13</sup> Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they *were* thy merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market. 

<sup>14</sup> They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules. 

<sup>15</sup> The men of Dedan *were* thy merchants; many isles *were* the merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee *for* a present horns of ivory and ebony. 

<sup>16</sup> Syria *was* thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate. 

<sup>17</sup> Judah, and the land of Israel, they *were* thy merchants: they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm. 

<sup>18</sup> Damascus *was* thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool. 

<sup>19</sup> Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market. 

<sup>20</sup> Dedan *was* thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots. 

<sup>21</sup> Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these *were they* thy merchants. 

<sup>22</sup> The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they *were* thy merchants: they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold. 

<sup>23</sup> Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, *and* Chilmad, *were* thy merchants. 

<sup>24</sup> These *were* thy merchants in all sorts *of things*, in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise. 

<sup>25</sup> The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas. 

<sup>26</sup> ¶ Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas. 

<sup>27</sup> Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that *are* in thee, and in all thy company which *is* in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin. 

<sup>28</sup> The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots. 

<sup>29</sup> And all that handle the oar, the mariners, *and* all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land; 

<sup>30</sup> And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes: 

<sup>31</sup> And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart *and* bitter wailing. 

<sup>32</sup> And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, *saying*, What *city is* like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea? 

<sup>33</sup> When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise. 

<sup>34</sup> In the time *when* thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall. 

<sup>35</sup> All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in *their* countenance. 

<sup>36</sup> The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be a terror, and never *shalt be* any more.
