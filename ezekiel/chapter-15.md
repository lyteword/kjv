# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

<sup>2</sup> Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, *or than* a branch which is among the trees of the forest? 

<sup>3</sup> Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will *men* take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? 

<sup>4</sup> Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for *any* work? 

<sup>5</sup> Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for *any* work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned? 

<sup>6</sup> ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 

<sup>7</sup> And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from *one* fire, and *another* fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I *am* the LORD, when I set my face against them. 

<sup>8</sup> And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.
