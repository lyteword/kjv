# Chapter 42

<sup>1</sup> Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that *was* over against the separate place, and which *was* before the building toward the north. 

<sup>2</sup> Before the length of an hundred cubits *was* the north door, and the breadth *was* fifty cubits. 

<sup>3</sup> Over against the twenty *cubits* which *were* for the inner court, and over against the pavement which *was* for the utter court, *was* gallery against gallery in three *stories*. 

<sup>4</sup> And before the chambers *was* a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north. 

<sup>5</sup> Now the upper chambers *were* shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building. 

<sup>6</sup> For they *were* in three *stories*, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore *the building* was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground. 

<sup>7</sup> And the wall that *was* without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof *was* fifty cubits. 

<sup>8</sup> For the length of the chambers that *were* in the utter court *was* fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple *were* an hundred cubits. 

<sup>9</sup> And from under these chambers *was* the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court. 

<sup>10</sup> The chambers *were* in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building. 

<sup>11</sup> And the way before them *was* like the appearance of the chambers which *were* toward the north, as long as they, *and* as broad as they: and all their goings out *were* both according to their fashions, and according to their doors. 

<sup>12</sup> And according to the doors of the chambers that *were* toward the south *was* a door in the head of the way, *even* the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them. 

<sup>13</sup> ¶ Then said he unto me, The north chambers *and* the south chambers, which *are* before the separate place, they *be* holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place *is* holy. 

<sup>14</sup> When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy *place* into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they *are* holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to *those things* which *are* for the people. 

<sup>15</sup> Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect *is* toward the east, and measured it round about. 

<sup>16</sup> He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. 

<sup>17</sup> He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. 

<sup>18</sup> He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed. 

<sup>19</sup> ¶ He turned about to the west side, *and* measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. 

<sup>20</sup> He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred *reeds* long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.
