# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. 

<sup>2</sup> And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, *even* under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter *them* over the city. And he went in in my sight. 

<sup>3</sup> Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. 

<sup>4</sup> Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, *and stood* over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD’s glory. 

<sup>5</sup> And the sound of the cherubims’ wings was heard *even* to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh. 

<sup>6</sup> And it came to pass, *that* when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels. 

<sup>7</sup> And *one* cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that *was* between the cherubims, and took *thereof*, and put *it* into the hands of *him that was* clothed with linen: who took *it*, and went out. 

<sup>8</sup> ¶ And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man’s hand under their wings. 

<sup>9</sup> And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels *was* as the colour of a beryl stone. 

<sup>10</sup> And *as for* their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel. 

<sup>11</sup> When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went. 

<sup>12</sup> And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, *were* full of eyes round about, *even* the wheels that they four had. 

<sup>13</sup> As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel. 

<sup>14</sup> And every one had four faces: the first face *was* the face of a cherub, and the second face *was* the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. 

<sup>15</sup> And the cherubims were lifted up. This *is* the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar. 

<sup>16</sup> And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them. 

<sup>17</sup> When they stood, *these* stood; and when they were lifted up, *these* lifted up themselves *also:* for the spirit of the living creature *was* in them. 

<sup>18</sup> Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims. 

<sup>19</sup> And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also *were* beside them, and *every one* stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD’s house; and the glory of the God of Israel *was* over them above. 

<sup>20</sup> This *is* the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they *were* the cherubims. 

<sup>21</sup> Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man *was* under their wings. 

<sup>22</sup> And the likeness of their faces *was* the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.
