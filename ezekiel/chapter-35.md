# Chapter 35

**¹** Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

**²** Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it, 

**³** And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I *am* against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate. 

**⁴** I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I *am* the LORD. 

**⁵** Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed *the blood of* the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time *that their* iniquity *had* an end: 

**⁶** Therefore, *as* I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee. 

**⁷** Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth. 

**⁸** And I will fill his mountains with his slain *men:* in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword. 

**⁹** I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I *am* the LORD. 

**¹⁰** Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there: 

**¹¹** Therefore, *as* I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee. 

**¹²** And thou shalt know that I *am* the LORD, *and that* I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume. 

**¹³** Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard *them*. 

**¹⁴** Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate. 

**¹⁵** As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, *even* all of it: and they shall know that I *am* the LORD.
