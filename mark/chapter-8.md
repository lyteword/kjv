# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples *unto him*, and saith unto them, 

<sup>2</sup> I have compassion on the multitude , because they have now been with me three days , and have nothing to eat : 

<sup>3</sup> And if I send them away fasting to their own houses , they will faint by the way : for divers of them came from far . 

<sup>4</sup> And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these *men* with bread here in the wilderness? 

<sup>5</sup> And he asked them, How many loaves have ye ? And they said, Seven. 

<sup>6</sup> And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before *them*; and they did set *them* before the people. 

<sup>7</sup> And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before *them*. 

<sup>8</sup> So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken *meat* that was left seven baskets. 

<sup>9</sup> And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away. 

<sup>10</sup> ¶ And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha. 

<sup>11</sup> And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him. 

<sup>12</sup> And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign ? verily I say unto you , There shall no sign be given unto this generation . 

<sup>13</sup> And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side. 

<sup>14</sup> ¶ Now *the disciples* had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf. 

<sup>15</sup> And he charged them, saying, Take heed , beware of the leaven of the Pharisees , and *of* the leaven of Herod . 

<sup>16</sup> And they reasoned among themselves, saying, *It is* because we have no bread. 

<sup>17</sup> And when Jesus knew *it*, he saith unto them, Why reason ye , because ye have no bread ? perceive ye not yet , neither understand ? have ye your heart yet hardened ? 

<sup>18</sup> Having eyes , see ye not ? and having ears , hear ye not ? and do ye not remember ? 

<sup>19</sup> When I brake the five loaves among five thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took ye up ? They say unto him, Twelve. 

<sup>20</sup> And when the seven among four thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took ye up ? And they said, Seven. 

<sup>21</sup> And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand ? 

<sup>22</sup> ¶ And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him. 

<sup>23</sup> And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought. 

<sup>24</sup> And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking. 

<sup>25</sup> After that he put *his* hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly. 

<sup>26</sup> And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town , nor tell *it* to any in the town . 

<sup>27</sup> ¶ And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Cæsarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am ? 

<sup>28</sup> And they answered, John the Baptist: but some *say*, Elias; and others, One of the prophets. 

<sup>29</sup> And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am ? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ. 

<sup>30</sup> And he charged them that they should tell no man of him. 

<sup>31</sup> And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and *of* the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. 

<sup>32</sup> And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. 

<sup>33</sup> But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me , Satan : for thou savourest not the things that be of God , but the things that be of men . 

<sup>34</sup> ¶ And when he had called the people *unto him* with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me . 

<sup>35</sup> For whosoever will save his life shall lose it ; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s , the same shall save it . 

<sup>36</sup> For what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ? 

<sup>37</sup> Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ? 

<sup>38</sup> Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation ; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed , when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels .
