# Mark 1 

**¹** The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; 

**²** As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. 

**³** The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 

**⁴** John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. 

**⁵** And there went out unto him all the land of Judæa, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins. 

**⁶** And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; 

**⁷** And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. 

**⁸** I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. 

**⁹** And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. 

**¹⁰** And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: 

**¹¹** And there came a voice from heaven, *saying*, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. 

**¹²** And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness. 

**¹³** And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him. 

**¹⁴** Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, 

**¹⁵** And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

**¹⁶** Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. 

**¹⁷** And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.

**¹⁸** And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him. 

**¹⁹** And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the *son* of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets. 

**²⁰** And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him. 

**²¹** And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught. 

**²²** And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes. 

**²³** And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, 

**²⁴** Saying, Let *us* alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. 

**²⁵** And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.

**²⁶** And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. 

**²⁷** And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine *is* this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him. 

**²⁸** And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee. 

**²⁹** And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 

**³⁰** But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her. 

**³¹** And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them. 

**³²** And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils. 

**³³** And all the city was gathered together at the door. 

**³⁴** And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him. 

**³⁵** And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. 

**³⁶** And Simon and they that were with him followed after him. 

**³⁷** And when they had found him, they said unto him, All *men* seek for thee. 

**³⁸** And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.

**³⁹** And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils. 

**⁴⁰** And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 

**⁴¹** And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth *his* hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.

**⁴²** And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed. 

**⁴³** And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; 

**⁴⁴** And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.

**⁴⁵** But he went out, and began to publish *it* much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
