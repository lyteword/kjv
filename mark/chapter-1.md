# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; 

<sup>2</sup> As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. 

<sup>3</sup> The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 

<sup>4</sup> John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. 

<sup>5</sup> And there went out unto him all the land of Judæa, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins. 

<sup>6</sup> And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; 

<sup>7</sup> And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. 

<sup>8</sup> I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. 

<sup>9</sup> And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. 

<sup>10</sup> And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: 

<sup>11</sup> And there came a voice from heaven, *saying*, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. 

<sup>12</sup> And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness. 

<sup>13</sup> And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him. 

<sup>14</sup> Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, 

<sup>15</sup> And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

<sup>16</sup> Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. 

<sup>17</sup> And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.

<sup>18</sup> And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him. 

<sup>19</sup> And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the *son* of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets. 

<sup>20</sup> And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him. 

<sup>21</sup> And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught. 

<sup>22</sup> And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes. 

<sup>23</sup> And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, 

<sup>24</sup> Saying, Let *us* alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. 

<sup>25</sup> And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.

<sup>26</sup> And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. 

<sup>27</sup> And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine *is* this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him. 

<sup>28</sup> And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee. 

<sup>29</sup> And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 

<sup>30</sup> But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her. 

<sup>31</sup> And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them. 

<sup>32</sup> And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils. 

<sup>33</sup> And all the city was gathered together at the door. 

<sup>34</sup> And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him. 

<sup>35</sup> And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. 

<sup>36</sup> And Simon and they that were with him followed after him. 

<sup>37</sup> And when they had found him, they said unto him, All *men* seek for thee. 

<sup>38</sup> And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.

<sup>39</sup> And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils. 

<sup>40</sup> And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 

<sup>41</sup> And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth *his* hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.

<sup>42</sup> And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed. 

<sup>43</sup> And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; 

<sup>44</sup> And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.

<sup>45</sup> But he went out, and began to publish *it* much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
