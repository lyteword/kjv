# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land. 

<sup>2</sup> And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine, 

<sup>3</sup> Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:

<sup>4</sup> And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.

<sup>5</sup> And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:

<sup>6</sup> But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.

<sup>7</sup> And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.

<sup>8</sup> And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.

<sup>9</sup> And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

<sup>10</sup> And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable. 

<sup>11</sup> And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all *these* things are done in parables:

<sup>12</sup> That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and *their* sins should be forgiven them.

<sup>13</sup> And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?

<sup>14</sup> ¶ The sower soweth the word.

<sup>15</sup> And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.

<sup>16</sup> And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;

<sup>17</sup> And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word’s sake, immediately they are offended.

<sup>18</sup> And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,

<sup>19</sup> And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.

<sup>20</sup> And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive *it*, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.

<sup>21</sup> ¶ And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?

<sup>22</sup> For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.

<sup>23</sup> If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

<sup>24</sup> And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be give n. 

<sup>25</sup> For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.

<sup>26</sup> ¶ And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;

<sup>27</sup> And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.

<sup>28</sup> For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.

<sup>29</sup> But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.

<sup>30</sup> ¶ And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?

<sup>31</sup> *It is* like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:

<sup>32</sup> But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.

<sup>33</sup> And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear *it*. 

<sup>34</sup> But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples. 

<sup>35</sup> And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.

<sup>36</sup> And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships. 

<sup>37</sup> And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. 

<sup>38</sup> And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? 

<sup>39</sup> And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. 

<sup>40</sup> And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?

<sup>41</sup> And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
