# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried *him* away, and delivered *him* to Pilate. 

<sup>2</sup> And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest *it*.

<sup>3</sup> And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing. 

<sup>4</sup> And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee. 

<sup>5</sup> But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled. 

<sup>6</sup> Now at *that* feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired. 

<sup>7</sup> And there was *one* named Barabbas, *which lay* bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection. 

<sup>8</sup> And the multitude crying aloud began to desire *him to do* as he had ever done unto them. 

<sup>9</sup> But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? 

<sup>10</sup> For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy. 

<sup>11</sup> But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them. 

<sup>12</sup> And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do *unto him* whom ye call the King of the Jews? 

<sup>13</sup> And they cried out again, Crucify him. 

<sup>14</sup> Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him. 

<sup>15</sup> ¶ And *so* Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged *him*, to be crucified. 

<sup>16</sup> And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Prætorium; and they call together the whole band. 

<sup>17</sup> And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his *head*, 

<sup>18</sup> And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! 

<sup>19</sup> And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing *their* knees worshipped him. 

<sup>20</sup> And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. 

<sup>21</sup> And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross. 

<sup>22</sup> And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. 

<sup>23</sup> And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received *it* not. 

<sup>24</sup> And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. 

<sup>25</sup> And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. 

<sup>26</sup> And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS. 

<sup>27</sup> And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. 

<sup>28</sup> And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors. 

<sup>29</sup> And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest *it* in three days, 

<sup>30</sup> Save thyself, and come down from the cross. 

<sup>31</sup> Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save. 

<sup>32</sup> Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him. 

<sup>33</sup> And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. 

<sup>34</sup> And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 

<sup>35</sup> And some of them that stood by, when they heard *it*, said, Behold, he calleth Elias. 

<sup>36</sup> And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put *it* on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down. 

<sup>37</sup> And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost. 

<sup>38</sup> And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. 

<sup>39</sup> ¶ And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God. 

<sup>40</sup> There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; 

<sup>41</sup> ( Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem. 

<sup>42</sup> ¶ And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, 

<sup>43</sup> Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. 

<sup>44</sup> And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling *unto him* the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead. 

<sup>45</sup> And when he knew *it* of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. 

<sup>46</sup> And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre. 

<sup>47</sup> And Mary Magdalene and Mary *the mother* of Joses beheld where he was laid.
