# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, 

<sup>2</sup> Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. 

<sup>3</sup> Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. 

<sup>4</sup> Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. 

<sup>5</sup> Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 

<sup>6</sup> Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: 

<sup>7</sup> But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: 

<sup>8</sup> And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. 

<sup>9</sup> Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: 

<sup>10</sup> That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; 

<sup>11</sup> And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. 

<sup>12</sup> Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. 

<sup>13</sup> For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. 

<sup>14</sup> Do all things without murmurings and disputings: 

<sup>15</sup> That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; 

<sup>16</sup> Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain. 

<sup>17</sup> Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. 

<sup>18</sup> For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me. 

<sup>19</sup> But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. 

<sup>20</sup> For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state. 

<sup>21</sup> For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christâ€™s. 

<sup>22</sup> But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel. 

<sup>23</sup> Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me. 

<sup>24</sup> But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly. 

<sup>25</sup> Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants. 

<sup>26</sup> For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick. 

<sup>27</sup> For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. 

<sup>28</sup> I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. 

<sup>29</sup> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation: 

<sup>30</sup> Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
