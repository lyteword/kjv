# Chapter 2

**¹** If *there be* therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, 

**²** Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like minded, having the same love, *being* of one accord, of one mind. 

**³** *Let* nothing *be done* through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. 

**⁴** Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. 

**⁵** Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 

**⁶** Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: 

**⁷** But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: 

**⁸** And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. 

**⁹** Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: 

**¹⁰** That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of *things* in heaven, and *things* in earth, and *things* under the earth; 

**¹¹** And *that* every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ *is* Lord, to the glory of God the Father. 

**¹²** Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. 

**¹³** For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of *his* good pleasure. 

**¹⁴** Do all things without murmurings and disputings: 

**¹⁵** That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; 

**¹⁶** Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain. 

**¹⁷** Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. 

**¹⁸** For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me. 

**¹⁹** But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. 

**²⁰** For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state. 

**²¹** For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s. 

**²²** But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel. 

**²³** Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me. 

**²⁴** But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly. 

**²⁵** Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants. 

**²⁶** For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick. 

**²⁷** For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. 

**²⁸** I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. 

**²⁹** Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation: 

**³⁰** Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
