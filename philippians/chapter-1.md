# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: 

<sup>2</sup> Grace *be* unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and *from* the Lord Jesus Christ. 

<sup>3</sup> I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, 

<sup>4</sup> Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, 

<sup>5</sup> For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now; 

<sup>6</sup> Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform *it* until the day of Jesus Christ: 

<sup>7</sup> Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. 

<sup>8</sup> For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ. 

<sup>9</sup> And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and *in* all judgment; 

<sup>10</sup> That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ; 

<sup>11</sup> Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. 

<sup>12</sup> But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things *which happened* unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel; 

<sup>13</sup> So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other *places*; 

<sup>14</sup> And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. 

<sup>15</sup> Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: 

<sup>16</sup> The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds: 

<sup>17</sup> But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel. 

<sup>18</sup> What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I there in do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. 

<sup>19</sup> For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 

<sup>20</sup> According to my earnest expectation and *my* hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but *that* with all boldness, as always, *so* now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether *it be* by life, or by death. 

<sup>21</sup> For to me to live *is* Christ, and to die *is* gain. 

<sup>22</sup> But if I live in the flesh, this *is* the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not. 

<sup>23</sup> For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better: 

<sup>24</sup> Nevertheless to abide in the flesh *is* more needful for you. 

<sup>25</sup> And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; 

<sup>26</sup> That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again. 

<sup>27</sup> Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; 

<sup>28</sup> And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. 

<sup>29</sup> For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake; 

<sup>30</sup> Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear *to be* in me.
