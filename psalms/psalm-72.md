# Psalm 72

<sup>1</sup> Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king’s son. 

<sup>2</sup> He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment. 

<sup>3</sup> The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness. 

<sup>4</sup> He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor. 

<sup>5</sup> They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations. 

<sup>6</sup> He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers *that* water the earth. 

<sup>7</sup> In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth. 

<sup>8</sup> He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. 

<sup>9</sup> They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust. 

<sup>10</sup> The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. 

<sup>11</sup> Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him. 

<sup>12</sup> For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and *him* that hath no helper. 

<sup>13</sup> He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy. 

<sup>14</sup> He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight. 

<sup>15</sup> And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; *and* daily shall he be praised. 

<sup>16</sup> There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and *they* of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth. 

<sup>17</sup> His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and *men* shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed. 

<sup>18</sup> Blessed *be* the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things. 

<sup>19</sup> And blessed *be* his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled *with* his glory; Amen, and Amen. 

<sup>20</sup> The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
