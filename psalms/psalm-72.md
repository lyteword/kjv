# Psalm 72 

**¹** Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king’s son. 

**²** He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment. 

**³** The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness. 

**⁴** He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor. 

**⁵** They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations. 

**⁶** He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers *that* water the earth. 

**⁷** In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth. 

**⁸** He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. 

**⁹** They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust. 

**¹⁰** The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. 

**¹¹** Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him. 

**¹²** For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and *him* that hath no helper. 

**¹³** He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy. 

**¹⁴** He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight. 

**¹⁵** And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; *and* daily shall he be praised. 

**¹⁶** There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and *they* of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth. 

**¹⁷** His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and *men* shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed. 

**¹⁸** Blessed *be* the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things. 

**¹⁹** And blessed *be* his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled *with* his glory; Amen, and Amen. 

**²⁰** The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
