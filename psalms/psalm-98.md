# Psalm 98 

**¹** O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory. 

**²** The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen. 

**³** He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 

**⁴** Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise. 

**⁵** Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm. 

**⁶** With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King. 

**⁷** Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. 

**⁸** Let the floods clap *their* hands: let the hills be joyful together 

**⁹** Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.
