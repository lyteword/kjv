# Psalm 9

**¹** I will praise *thee*, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works. 

**²** I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High. 

**³** When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence. 

**⁴** For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right. 

**⁵** Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever. 

**⁶** O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them. 

**⁷** But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment. 

**⁸** And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness. 

**⁹** The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. 

**¹⁰** And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. 

**¹¹** Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings. 

**¹²** When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble. 

**¹³** Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble *which I suffer* of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death: 

**¹⁴** That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation. 

**¹⁵** The heathen are sunk down in the pit *that* they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken. 

**¹⁶** The LORD is known *by* the judgment *which* he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah. 

**¹⁷** The wicked shall be turned into hell, *and* all the nations that forget God. 

**¹⁸** For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall *not* perish for ever. 

**¹⁹** Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight. 

**²⁰** Put them in fear, O LORD: *that* the nations may know themselves *to be but* men. Selah.
