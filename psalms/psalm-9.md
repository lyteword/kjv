# Psalm 9

<sup>1</sup> I will praise *thee*, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works. 

<sup>2</sup> I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High. 

<sup>3</sup> When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence. 

<sup>4</sup> For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right. 

<sup>5</sup> Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever. 

<sup>6</sup> O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them. 

<sup>7</sup> But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment. 

<sup>8</sup> And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness. 

<sup>9</sup> The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. 

<sup>10</sup> And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. 

<sup>11</sup> Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings. 

<sup>12</sup> When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble. 

<sup>13</sup> Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble *which I suffer* of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death: 

<sup>14</sup> That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation. 

<sup>15</sup> The heathen are sunk down in the pit *that* they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken. 

<sup>16</sup> The LORD is known *by* the judgment *which* he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah. 

<sup>17</sup> The wicked shall be turned into hell, *and* all the nations that forget God. 

<sup>18</sup> For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall *not* perish for ever. 

<sup>19</sup> Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight. 

<sup>20</sup> Put them in fear, O LORD: *that* the nations may know themselves *to be but* men. Selah.
