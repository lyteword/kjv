# Psalm 21

<sup>1</sup> The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice! 

<sup>2</sup> Thou hast given him his heart’s desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah. 

<sup>3</sup> For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head. 

<sup>4</sup> He asked life of thee, *and* thou gavest *it* him, *even* length of days for ever and ever. 

<sup>5</sup> His glory *is* great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him. 

<sup>6</sup> For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance. 

<sup>7</sup> For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved. 

<sup>8</sup> Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee. 

<sup>9</sup> Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them. 

<sup>10</sup> Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men. 

<sup>11</sup> For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, *which* they are not able *to perform*. 

<sup>12</sup> Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, *when* thou shalt make ready *thine arrows* upon thy strings against the face of them. 

<sup>13</sup> Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: *so* will we sing and praise thy power.
