# Psalm 65

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician, A Psalm and Song of David. Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed. 

<sup>2</sup> O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come. 

<sup>3</sup> Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away. 

<sup>4</sup> Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple. 

<sup>5</sup> By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea: 

<sup>6</sup> Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with power: 

<sup>7</sup> Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people. 

<sup>8</sup> They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice. 

<sup>9</sup> Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it. 

<sup>10</sup> Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof. 

<sup>11</sup> Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness. 

<sup>12</sup> They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side. 

<sup>13</sup> The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.
