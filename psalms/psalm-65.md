# Psalm 65 

**¹** Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed. 

**²** O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come. 

**³** Iniquities prevail against me: *as for* our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away. 

**⁴** Blessed *is the man whom* thou choosest, and causest to approach *unto thee, that* he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, *even* of thy holy temple. 

**⁵** *By* terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; *who art* the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off *upon* the sea: 

**⁶** Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; *being* girded with power: 

**⁷** Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people. 

**⁸** They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice. 

**⁹** Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, *which* is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it. 

**¹⁰** Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof. 

**¹¹** Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness. 

**¹²** They drop *upon* the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side. 

**¹³** The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.
