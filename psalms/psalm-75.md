# Psalm 75

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, A Psalm or Song of Asaph. Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare. 

<sup>2</sup> When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly. 

<sup>3</sup> The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah. 

<sup>4</sup> I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: 

<sup>5</sup> Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck. 

<sup>6</sup> For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. 

<sup>7</sup> But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another. 

<sup>8</sup> For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them. 

<sup>9</sup> But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 

<sup>10</sup> All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
