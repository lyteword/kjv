# Psalm 75 

**¹** Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, *unto thee* do we give thanks: for *that* thy name is near thy wondrous works declare. 

**²** When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly. 

**³** The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah. 

**⁴** I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: 

**⁵** Lift not up your horn on high: speak *not with* a stiff neck. 

**⁶** For promotion *cometh* neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. 

**⁷** But God *is* the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another. 

**⁸** For in the hand of the LORD *there is* a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring *them* out, *and* drink *them*. 

**⁹** But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 

**¹⁰** All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; *but* the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
