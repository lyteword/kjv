# Psalm 133 

**¹** Behold, how good and how pleasant *it is* for brethren to dwell together in unity! 

**²** *It is* like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, *even* Aaron’s beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments; 

**³** As the dew of Hermon, *and as the dew* that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, *even* life for evermore.
