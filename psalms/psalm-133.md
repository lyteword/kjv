# Psalm 133

<sup>1</sup> A Song of degrees of David. Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! 

<sup>2</sup> It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaronâ€™s beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments; 

<sup>3</sup> As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.
