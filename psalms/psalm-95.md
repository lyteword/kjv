# Psalm 95

<sup>1</sup> O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. 

<sup>2</sup> Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. 

<sup>3</sup> For the LORD *is* a great God, and a great King above all gods. 

<sup>4</sup> In his hand *are* the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills *is* his also. 

<sup>5</sup> The sea *is* his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry *land*. 

<sup>6</sup> O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker. 

<sup>7</sup> For he *is* our God; and we *are* the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice, 

<sup>8</sup> Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, *and* as *in* the day of temptation in the wilderness: 

<sup>9</sup> When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work. 

<sup>10</sup> Forty years long was I grieved with *this* generation, and said, It *is* a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways: 

<sup>11</sup> Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.
