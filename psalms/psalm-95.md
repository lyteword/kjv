# Psalm 95 

**¹** O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. 

**²** Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. 

**³** For the LORD *is* a great God, and a great King above all gods. 

**⁴** In his hand *are* the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills *is* his also. 

**⁵** The sea *is* his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry *land*. 

**⁶** O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker. 

**⁷** For he *is* our God; and we *are* the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice, 

**⁸** Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, *and* as *in* the day of temptation in the wilderness: 

**⁹** When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work. 

**¹⁰** Forty years long was I grieved with *this* generation, and said, It *is* a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways: 

**¹¹** Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.
