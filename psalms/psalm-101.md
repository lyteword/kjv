# Psalm 101

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing. 

<sup>2</sup> I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. 

<sup>3</sup> I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me. 

<sup>4</sup> A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person. 

<sup>5</sup> Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer. 

<sup>6</sup> Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me. 

<sup>7</sup> He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight. 

<sup>8</sup> I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.
