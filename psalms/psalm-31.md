# Psalm 31

<sup>1</sup> In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness. 

<sup>2</sup> Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me. 

<sup>3</sup> For thou *art* my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name’s sake lead me, and guide me. 

<sup>4</sup> Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou *art* my strength. 

<sup>5</sup> Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth. 

<sup>6</sup> I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD. 

<sup>7</sup> I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities; 

<sup>8</sup> And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room. 

<sup>9</sup> Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, *yea*, my soul and my belly. 

<sup>10</sup> For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed. 

<sup>11</sup> I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me. 

<sup>12</sup> I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel. 

<sup>13</sup> For I have heard the slander of many: fear *was* on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life. 

<sup>14</sup> But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou *art* my God. 

<sup>15</sup> My times *are* in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me. 

<sup>16</sup> Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies’ sake. 

<sup>17</sup> Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, *and* let them be silent in the grave. 

<sup>18</sup> Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous. 

<sup>19</sup> *Oh* how great *is* thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; *which* thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men! 

<sup>20</sup> Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. 

<sup>21</sup> Blessed *be* the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city. 

<sup>22</sup> For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee. 

<sup>23</sup> O love the LORD, all ye his saints: *for* the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer. 

<sup>24</sup> Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.
