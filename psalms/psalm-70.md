# Psalm 70

<sup>1</sup> *Make haste*, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD. 

<sup>2</sup> Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt. 

<sup>3</sup> Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha. 

<sup>4</sup> Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. 

<sup>5</sup> But I *am* poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou *art* my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.
