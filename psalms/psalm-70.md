# Psalm 70

**¹** *Make haste*, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD. 

**²** Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt. 

**³** Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha. 

**⁴** Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. 

**⁵** But I *am* poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou *art* my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.
