# Psalm 16

**¹** Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust. 

**²** *O my soul*, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou *art* my Lord: my goodness *extendeth* not to thee; 

**³** *But* to the saints that *are* in the earth, and *to* the excellent, in whom *is* all my delight. 

**⁴** Their sorrows shall be multiplied *that* hasten *after* another *god:* their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips. 

**⁵** The LORD *is* the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot. 

**⁶** The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant *places;* yea, I have a goodly heritage. 

**⁷** I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons. 

**⁸** I have set the LORD always before me: because *he is* at my right hand, I shall not be moved. 

**⁹** Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope. 

**¹⁰** For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. 

**¹¹** Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence *is* fulness of joy; at thy right hand *there are* pleasures for evermore.
