# Psalm 140 

**¹** Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man; 

**²** Which imagine mischiefs in *their* heart; continually are they gathered together *for* war. 

**³** They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders’ poison *is* under their lips. Selah. 

**⁴** Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings. 

**⁵** The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah. 

**⁶** I said unto the LORD, Thou *art* my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD. 

**⁷** O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle. 

**⁸** Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; *lest* they exalt themselves. Selah. 

**⁹** *As for* the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them. 

**¹⁰** Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again. 

**¹¹** Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow *him*. 

**¹²** I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, *and* the right of the poor. 

**¹³** Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
