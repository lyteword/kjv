# Psalm 29

**¹** Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 

**²** Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. 

**³** The voice of the LORD *is* upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the LORD *is* upon many waters. 

**⁴** The voice of the LORD *is* powerful; the voice of the LORD *is* full of majesty. 

**⁵** The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon. 

**⁶** He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn. 

**⁷** The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire. 

**⁸** The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. 

**⁹** The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of *his* glory. 

**¹⁰** The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever. 

**¹¹** The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.
