# Psalm 29

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 

<sup>2</sup> Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. 

<sup>3</sup> The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters. 

<sup>4</sup> The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty. 

<sup>5</sup> The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon. 

<sup>6</sup> He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn. 

<sup>7</sup> The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire. 

<sup>8</sup> The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. 

<sup>9</sup> The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory. 

<sup>10</sup> The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever. 

<sup>11</sup> The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.
