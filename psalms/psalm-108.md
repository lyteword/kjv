# Psalm 108 

**¹** O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. 

**²** Awake, psaltery and harp: I *myself* will awake early. 

**³** I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. 

**⁴** For thy mercy *is* great above the heavens: and thy truth *reacheth* unto the clouds. 

**⁵** Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth; 

**⁶** That thy beloved may be delivered: save *with* thy right hand, and answer me. 

**⁷** God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 

**⁸** Gilead *is* mine; Manasseh *is* mine; Ephraim also *is* the strength of mine head; Judah *is* my lawgiver; 

**⁹** Moab *is* my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph. 

**¹⁰** Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? 

**¹¹** *Wilt* not *thou*, O God, *who* hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts? 

**¹²** Give us help from trouble: for vain *is* the help of man. 

**¹³** Through God we shall do valiantly: for he *it is that* shall tread down our enemies.
