# Psalm 108

<sup>1</sup> O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. 

<sup>2</sup> Awake, psaltery and harp: I *myself* will awake early. 

<sup>3</sup> I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. 

<sup>4</sup> For thy mercy *is* great above the heavens: and thy truth *reacheth* unto the clouds. 

<sup>5</sup> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth; 

<sup>6</sup> That thy beloved may be delivered: save *with* thy right hand, and answer me. 

<sup>7</sup> God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 

<sup>8</sup> Gilead *is* mine; Manasseh *is* mine; Ephraim also *is* the strength of mine head; Judah *is* my lawgiver; 

<sup>9</sup> Moab *is* my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph. 

<sup>10</sup> Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? 

<sup>11</sup> *Wilt* not *thou*, O God, *who* hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts? 

<sup>12</sup> Give us help from trouble: for vain *is* the help of man. 

<sup>13</sup> Through God we shall do valiantly: for he *it is that* shall tread down our enemies.
