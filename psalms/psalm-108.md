# Psalm 108

<sup>1</sup> A Song or Psalm of David. O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. 

<sup>2</sup> Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early. 

<sup>3</sup> I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. 

<sup>4</sup> For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds. 

<sup>5</sup> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth; 

<sup>6</sup> That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me. 

<sup>7</sup> God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 

<sup>8</sup> Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver; 

<sup>9</sup> Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph. 

<sup>10</sup> Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? 

<sup>11</sup> Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts? 

<sup>12</sup> Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. 

<sup>13</sup> Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
