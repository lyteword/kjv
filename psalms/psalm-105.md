# Psalm 105

<sup>1</sup> O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people. 

<sup>2</sup> Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works. 

<sup>3</sup> Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. 

<sup>4</sup> Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore. 

<sup>5</sup> Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; 

<sup>6</sup> O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen. 

<sup>7</sup> He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth. 

<sup>8</sup> He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations. 

<sup>9</sup> Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; 

<sup>10</sup> And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant: 

<sup>11</sup> Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: 

<sup>12</sup> When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it. 

<sup>13</sup> When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people; 

<sup>14</sup> He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; 

<sup>15</sup> Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. 

<sup>16</sup> Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread. 

<sup>17</sup> He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant: 

<sup>18</sup> Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron: 

<sup>19</sup> Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him. 

<sup>20</sup> The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free. 

<sup>21</sup> He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: 

<sup>22</sup> To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom. 

<sup>23</sup> Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 

<sup>24</sup> And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies. 

<sup>25</sup> He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants. 

<sup>26</sup> He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen. 

<sup>27</sup> They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. 

<sup>28</sup> He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word. 

<sup>29</sup> He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. 

<sup>30</sup> Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings. 

<sup>31</sup> He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts. 

<sup>32</sup> He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land. 

<sup>33</sup> He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts. 

<sup>34</sup> He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number, 

<sup>35</sup> And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground. 

<sup>36</sup> He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength. 

<sup>37</sup> He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes. 

<sup>38</sup> Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them. 

<sup>39</sup> He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. 

<sup>40</sup> The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. 

<sup>41</sup> He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river. 

<sup>42</sup> For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant. 

<sup>43</sup> And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness: 

<sup>44</sup> And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people; 

<sup>45</sup> That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.
