# Psalm 105

**¹** O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people. 

**²** Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works. 

**³** Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. 

**⁴** Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore. 

**⁵** Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; 

**⁶** O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen. 

**⁷** He *is* the LORD our God: his judgments *are* in all the earth. 

**⁸** He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word *which* he commanded to a thousand generations. 

**⁹** Which *covenant* he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; 

**¹⁰** And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, *and* to Israel *for* an everlasting covenant: 

**¹¹** Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: 

**¹²** When they were *but* a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it. 

**¹³** When they went from one nation to another, from *one* kingdom to another people; 

**¹⁴** He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; 

**¹⁵** *Saying*, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. 

**¹⁶** Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread. 

**¹⁷** He sent a man before them, *even* Joseph, *who* was sold for a servant: 

**¹⁸** Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron: 

**¹⁹** Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him. 

**²⁰** The king sent and loosed him; *even* the ruler of the people, and let him go free. 

**²¹** He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: 

**²²** To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom. 

**²³** Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 

**²⁴** And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies. 

**²⁵** He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants. 

**²⁶** He sent Moses his servant; *and* Aaron whom he had chosen. 

**²⁷** They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. 

**²⁸** He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word. 

**²⁹** He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. 

**³⁰** Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings. 

**³¹** He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, *and* lice in all their coasts. 

**³²** He gave them hail for rain, *and* flaming fire in their land. 

**³³** He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts. 

**³⁴** He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number, 

**³⁵** And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground. 

**³⁶** He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength. 

**³⁷** He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and *there was* not one feeble *person* among their tribes. 

**³⁸** Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them. 

**³⁹** He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. 

**⁴⁰** *The people* asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. 

**⁴¹** He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places *like* a river. 

**⁴²** For he remembered his holy promise, *and* Abraham his servant. 

**⁴³** And he brought forth his people with joy, *and* his chosen with gladness: 

**⁴⁴** And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people; 

**⁴⁵** That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.
