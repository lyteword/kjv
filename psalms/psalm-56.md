# Psalm 56 

**¹** Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me. 

**²** Mine enemies would daily swallow *me* up: for *they be* many that fight against me, O thou most High. 

**³** What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. 

**⁴** In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me. 

**⁵** Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts *are* against me for evil. 

**⁶** They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul. 

**⁷** Shall they escape by iniquity? in *thine* anger cast down the people, O God. 

**⁸** Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: *are they* not in thy book? 

**⁹** When I cry *unto thee*, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God *is* for me. 

**¹⁰** In God will I praise *his* word: in the LORD will I praise *his* word. 

**¹¹** In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me. 

**¹²** Thy vows *are* upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee. 

**¹³** For thou hast delivered my soul from death: *wilt* not *thou deliver* my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
