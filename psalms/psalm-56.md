# Psalm 56

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician upon Jonath-elem-rechokim, Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath. Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me. 

<sup>2</sup> Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High. 

<sup>3</sup> What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. 

<sup>4</sup> In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me. 

<sup>5</sup> Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil. 

<sup>6</sup> They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul. 

<sup>7</sup> Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people, O God. 

<sup>8</sup> Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book? 

<sup>9</sup> When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me. 

<sup>10</sup> In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word. 

<sup>11</sup> In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me. 

<sup>12</sup> Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee. 

<sup>13</sup> For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
