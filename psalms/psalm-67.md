# Psalm 67

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm or Song. God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah. 

<sup>2</sup> That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations. 

<sup>3</sup> Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. 

<sup>4</sup> O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah. 

<sup>5</sup> Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. 

<sup>6</sup> Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us. 

<sup>7</sup> God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
