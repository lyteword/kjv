# Psalm 32 

**¹** Blessed *is he whose* transgression *is* forgiven, *whose* sin *is* covered. 

**²** Blessed *is* the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit *there is* no guile. 

**³** When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long. 

**⁴** For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah. 

**⁵** I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah. 

**⁶** For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him. 

**⁷** Thou *art* my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah. 

**⁸** I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. 

**⁹** Be ye not as the horse, *or* as the mule, *which* have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee. 

**¹⁰** Many sorrows *shall be* to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about. 

**¹¹** Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all *ye that are* upright in heart.
