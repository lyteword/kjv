# Psalm 120 

**¹** In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me. 

**²** Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, *and* from a deceitful tongue. 

**³** What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue? 

**⁴** Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper. 

**⁵** Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, *that* I dwell in the tents of Kedar! 

**⁶** My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace. 

**⁷** I *am for* peace: but when I speak, they *are* for war.
