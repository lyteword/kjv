# Psalm 120

<sup>1</sup> A Song of degrees. In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me. 

<sup>2</sup> Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue. 

<sup>3</sup> What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue? 

<sup>4</sup> Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper. 

<sup>5</sup> Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar! 

<sup>6</sup> My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace. 

<sup>7</sup> I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.
