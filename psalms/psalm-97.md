# Psalm 97 

**¹** The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad *thereof*. 

**²** Clouds and darkness *are* round about him: righteousness and judgment *are* the habitation of his throne. 

**³** A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about. 

**⁴** His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled. 

**⁵** The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 

**⁶** The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory. 

**⁷** Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all *ye* gods. 

**⁸** Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD. 

**⁹** For thou, LORD, *art* high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods. 

**¹⁰** Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. 

**¹¹** Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. 

**¹²** Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.
