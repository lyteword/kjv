# Psalm 104

**¹** Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty. 

**²** Who coverest *thyself* with light as *with* a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain: 

**³** Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind: 

**⁴** Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire: 

**⁵** *Who* laid the foundations of the earth, *that* it should not be removed for ever. 

**⁶** Thou coveredst it with the deep as *with* a garment: the waters stood above the mountains. 

**⁷** At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away. 

**⁸** They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them. 

**⁹** Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth. 

**¹⁰** He sendeth the springs into the valleys, *which* run among the hills. 

**¹¹** They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst. 

**¹²** By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, *which* sing among the branches. 

**¹³** He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. 

**¹⁴** He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth; 

**¹⁵** And wine *that* maketh glad the heart of man, *and* oil to make *his* face to shine, and bread *which* strengtheneth man’s heart. 

**¹⁶** The trees of the LORD are full *of sap;* the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; 

**¹⁷** Where the birds make their nests: *as for* the stork, the fir trees *are* her house. 

**¹⁸** The high hills *are* a refuge for the wild goats; *and* the rocks for the conies. 

**¹⁹** He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down. 

**²⁰** Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep *forth*. 

**²¹** The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God. 

**²²** The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens. 

**²³** Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening. 

**²⁴** O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. 

**²⁵** *So is* this great and wide sea, wherein *are* things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts. 

**²⁶** There go the ships: *there is* that leviathan, *whom* thou hast made to play therein. 

**²⁷** These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give *them* their meat in due season. 

**²⁸** *That* thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good. 

**²⁹** Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust. 

**³⁰** Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth. 

**³¹** The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works. 

**³²** He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke. 

**³³** I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. 

**³⁴** My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD. 

**³⁵** Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.
