# Psalm 104

<sup>1</sup> Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty. 

<sup>2</sup> Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain: 

<sup>3</sup> Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind: 

<sup>4</sup> Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire: 

<sup>5</sup> Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever. 

<sup>6</sup> Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains. 

<sup>7</sup> At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away. 

<sup>8</sup> They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them. 

<sup>9</sup> Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills. 

<sup>11</sup> They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst. 

<sup>12</sup> By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches. 

<sup>13</sup> He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. 

<sup>14</sup> He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth; 

<sup>15</sup> And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth manâ€™s heart. 

<sup>16</sup> The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; 

<sup>17</sup> Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house. 

<sup>18</sup> The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies. 

<sup>19</sup> He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down. 

<sup>20</sup> Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth. 

<sup>21</sup> The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God. 

<sup>22</sup> The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens. 

<sup>23</sup> Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening. 

<sup>24</sup> O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. 

<sup>25</sup> So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts. 

<sup>26</sup> There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein. 

<sup>27</sup> These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season. 

<sup>28</sup> That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good. 

<sup>29</sup> Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust. 

<sup>30</sup> Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth. 

<sup>31</sup> The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works. 

<sup>32</sup> He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke. 

<sup>33</sup> I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. 

<sup>34</sup> My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD. 

<sup>35</sup> Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.
