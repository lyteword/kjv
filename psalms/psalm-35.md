# Psalm 35

<sup>1</sup> Plead *my cause*, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me. 

<sup>2</sup> Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help. 

<sup>3</sup> Draw out also the spear, and stop *the way* against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I *am* thy salvation. 

<sup>4</sup> Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt. 

<sup>5</sup> Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase *them*. 

<sup>6</sup> Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them. 

<sup>7</sup> For without cause have they hid for me their net *in* a pit, *which* without cause they have digged for my soul. 

<sup>8</sup> Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall. 

<sup>9</sup> And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation. 

<sup>10</sup> All my bones shall say, LORD, who *is* like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him? 

<sup>11</sup> False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge *things* that I knew not. 

<sup>12</sup> They rewarded me evil for good *to* the spoiling of my soul. 

<sup>13</sup> But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing *was* sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom. 

<sup>14</sup> I behaved myself as though *he had been* my friend *or* brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth *for his* mother. 

<sup>15</sup> But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: *yea*, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew *it* not; they did tear *me*, and ceased not: 

<sup>16</sup> With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth. 

<sup>17</sup> Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions. 

<sup>18</sup> I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people. 

<sup>19</sup> Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: *neither* let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause. 

<sup>20</sup> For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against *them that are* quiet in the land. 

<sup>21</sup> Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, *and* said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen *it*. 

<sup>22</sup> *This* thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me. 

<sup>23</sup> Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, *even* unto my cause, my God and my Lord. 

<sup>24</sup> Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me. 

<sup>25</sup> Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up. 

<sup>26</sup> Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify *themselves* against me. 

<sup>27</sup> Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant. 

<sup>28</sup> And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness *and* of thy praise all the day long.
