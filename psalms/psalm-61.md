# Psalm 61

<sup>1</sup> Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. 

<sup>2</sup> From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock *that* is higher than I. 

<sup>3</sup> For thou hast been a shelter for me, *and* a strong tower from the enemy. 

<sup>4</sup> I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah. 

<sup>5</sup> For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given *me* the heritage of those that fear thy name. 

<sup>6</sup> Thou wilt prolong the king’s life: *and* his years as many generations. 

<sup>7</sup> He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, *which* may preserve him. 

<sup>8</sup> So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
