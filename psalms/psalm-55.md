# Psalm 55

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, A Psalm of David. Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication. 

<sup>2</sup> Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise; 

<sup>3</sup> Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me. 

<sup>4</sup> My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me. 

<sup>5</sup> Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me. 

<sup>6</sup> And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest. 

<sup>7</sup> Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah. 

<sup>8</sup> I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest. 

<sup>9</sup> Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city. 

<sup>10</sup> Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it. 

<sup>11</sup> Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets. 

<sup>12</sup> For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him: 

<sup>13</sup> But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance. 

<sup>14</sup> We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company. 

<sup>15</sup> Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them. 

<sup>16</sup> As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me. 

<sup>17</sup> Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice. 

<sup>18</sup> He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me. 

<sup>19</sup> God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God. 

<sup>20</sup> He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant. 

<sup>21</sup> The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords. 

<sup>22</sup> Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. 

<sup>23</sup> But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.
