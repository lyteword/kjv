# Psalm 83

<sup>1</sup> Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God. 

<sup>2</sup> For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. 

<sup>3</sup> They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. 

<sup>4</sup> They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from *being* a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. 

<sup>5</sup> For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee: 

<sup>6</sup> The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes; 

<sup>7</sup> Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre; 

<sup>8</sup> Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah. 

<sup>9</sup> Do unto them as *unto* the Midianites; as *to* Sisera, as *to* Jabin, at the brook of Kison: 

<sup>10</sup> *Which* perished at Endor: they became *as* dung for the earth. 

<sup>11</sup> Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna: 

<sup>12</sup> Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession. 

<sup>13</sup> O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind. 

<sup>14</sup> As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire; 

<sup>15</sup> So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. 

<sup>16</sup> Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD. 

<sup>17</sup> Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish: 

<sup>18</sup> That *men* may know that thou, whose name alone *is* JEHOVAH, *art* the most high over all the earth.
