# Psalm 33

**¹** Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: *for* praise is comely for the upright. 

**²** Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery *and* an instrument of ten strings. 

**³** Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise. 

**⁴** For the word of the LORD *is* right; and all his works *are done* in truth. 

**⁵** He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD. 

**⁶** By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. 

**⁷** He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses. 

**⁸** Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. 

**⁹** For he spake, and it was *done;* he commanded, and it stood fast. 

**¹⁰** The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect. 

**¹¹** The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations. 

**¹²** Blessed *is* the nation whose God *is* the LORD; *and* the people *whom* he hath chosen for his own inheritance. 

**¹³** The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men. 

**¹⁴** From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth. 

**¹⁵** He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works. 

**¹⁶** There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. 

**¹⁷** An horse *is* a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver *any* by his great strength. 

**¹⁸** Behold, the eye of the LORD *is* upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy; 

**¹⁹** To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. 

**²⁰** Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he *is* our help and our shield. 

**²¹** For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. 

**²²** Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.
