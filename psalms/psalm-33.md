# Psalm 33

<sup>1</sup> Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright. 

<sup>2</sup> Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings. 

<sup>3</sup> Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise. 

<sup>4</sup> For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth. 

<sup>5</sup> He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD. 

<sup>6</sup> By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. 

<sup>7</sup> He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses. 

<sup>8</sup> Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. 

<sup>9</sup> For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast. 

<sup>10</sup> The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect. 

<sup>11</sup> The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations. 

<sup>12</sup> Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance. 

<sup>13</sup> The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men. 

<sup>14</sup> From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth. 

<sup>15</sup> He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works. 

<sup>16</sup> There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. 

<sup>17</sup> An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength. 

<sup>18</sup> Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy; 

<sup>19</sup> To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. 

<sup>20</sup> Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield. 

<sup>21</sup> For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. 

<sup>22</sup> Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.
