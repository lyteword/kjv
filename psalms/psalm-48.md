# Psalm 48

**¹** Great *is* the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, *in* the mountain of his holiness. 

**²** Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, *is* mount Zion, *on* the sides of the north, the city of the great King. 

**³** God is known in her palaces for a refuge. 

**⁴** For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together. 

**⁵** They saw *it, and* so they marvelled; they were troubled, *and* hasted away. 

**⁶** Fear took hold upon them there, *and* pain, as of a woman in travail. 

**⁷** Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind. 

**⁸** As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah. 

**⁹** We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple. 

**¹⁰** According to thy name, O God, so *is* thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness. 

**¹¹** Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments. 

**¹²** Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof. 

**¹³** Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell *it* to the generation following. 

**¹⁴** For this God *is* our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide *even* unto death.
