# Psalm 48

<sup>1</sup> A Song and Psalm for the sons of Korah. Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness. 

<sup>2</sup> Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King. 

<sup>3</sup> God is known in her palaces for a refuge. 

<sup>4</sup> For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together. 

<sup>5</sup> They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away. 

<sup>6</sup> Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail. 

<sup>7</sup> Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind. 

<sup>8</sup> As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah. 

<sup>9</sup> We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple. 

<sup>10</sup> According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness. 

<sup>11</sup> Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments. 

<sup>12</sup> Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof. 

<sup>13</sup> Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following. 

<sup>14</sup> For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.
