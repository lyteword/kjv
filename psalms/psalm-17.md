# Psalm 17 

**¹** Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, *that goeth* not out of feigned lips. 

**²** Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal. 

**³** Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited *me* in the night; thou hast tried me, *and* shalt find nothing; I am purposed *that* my mouth shall not transgress. 

**⁴** Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept *me from* the paths of the destroyer. 

**⁵** Hold up my goings in thy paths, *that* my footsteps slip not. 

**⁶** I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, *and hear* my speech. 

**⁷** Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust *in thee* from those that rise up *against them*. 

**⁸** Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings, 

**⁹** From the wicked that oppress me, *from* my deadly enemies, *who* compass me about. 

**¹⁰** They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly. 

**¹¹** They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth; 

**¹²** Like as a lion *that* is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. 

**¹³** Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, *which is* thy sword: 

**¹⁴** From men *which are* thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, *which have* their portion in *this* life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid *treasure:* they are full of children, and leave the rest of their *substance* to their babes. 

**¹⁵** As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
