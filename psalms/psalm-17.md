# Psalm 17

<sup>1</sup> A Prayer of David. Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips. 

<sup>2</sup> Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal. 

<sup>3</sup> Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress. 

<sup>4</sup> Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer. 

<sup>5</sup> Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not. 

<sup>6</sup> I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me,  and hear my speech. 

<sup>7</sup> Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them. 

<sup>8</sup> Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings, 

<sup>9</sup> From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about. 

<sup>10</sup> They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly. 

<sup>11</sup> They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth; 

<sup>12</sup> Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. 

<sup>13</sup> Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword: 

<sup>14</sup> From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes. 

<sup>15</sup> As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
