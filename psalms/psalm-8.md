# Psalm 8 

**¹** O LORD our Lord, how excellent *is* thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. 

**²** Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. 

**³** When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; 

**⁴** What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? 

**⁵** For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. 

**⁶** Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all *things* under his feet: 

**⁷** All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; 

**⁸** The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, *and whatsoever* passeth through the paths of the seas. 

**⁹** O LORD our Lord, how excellent *is* thy name in all the earth!
