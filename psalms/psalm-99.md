# Psalm 99 

**¹** The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth *between* the cherubims; let the earth be moved. 

**²** The LORD *is* great in Zion; and he *is* high above all the people. 

**³** Let them praise thy great and terrible name; *for* it *is* holy. 

**⁴** The king’s strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. 

**⁵** Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; *for* he *is* holy. 

**⁶** Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them. 

**⁷** He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance *that* he gave them. 

**⁸** Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions. 

**⁹** Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God *is* holy.
