# Psalm 74

**¹** O God, why hast thou cast *us* off for ever? *why* doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture? 

**²** Remember thy congregation, *which* thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, *which* thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt. 

**³** Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; *even* all *that* the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. 

**⁴** Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns *for* signs. 

**⁵** *A man* was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees. 

**⁶** But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers. 

**⁷** They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled *by casting down* the dwelling place of thy name to the ground. 

**⁸** They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land. 

**⁹** We see not our signs: *there is* no more any prophet: neither *is there* among us any that knoweth how long. 

**¹⁰** O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever? 

**¹¹** Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck *it* out of thy bosom. 

**¹²** For God *is* my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. 

**¹³** Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters. 

**¹⁴** Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, *and* gavest him *to be* meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness. 

**¹⁵** Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers. 

**¹⁶** The day *is* thine, the night also *is* thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun. 

**¹⁷** Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter. 

**¹⁸** Remember this, *that* the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and *that* the foolish people have blasphemed thy name. 

**¹⁹** O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude *of the wicked:* forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever. 

**²⁰** Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty. 

**²¹** O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name. 

**²²** Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily. 

**²³** Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.
