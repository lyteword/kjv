# Psalm 6

<sup>1</sup> O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 

<sup>2</sup> Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I *am* weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed. 

<sup>3</sup> My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long? 

<sup>4</sup> Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies’ sake. 

<sup>5</sup> For in death *there is* no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks? 

<sup>6</sup> I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. 

<sup>7</sup> Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies. 

<sup>8</sup> Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping. 

<sup>9</sup> The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer. 

<sup>10</sup> Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return *and* be ashamed suddenly.
