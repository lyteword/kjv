# Psalm 6

**¹** O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 

**²** Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I *am* weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed. 

**³** My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long? 

**⁴** Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies’ sake. 

**⁵** For in death *there is* no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks? 

**⁶** I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. 

**⁷** Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies. 

**⁸** Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping. 

**⁹** The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer. 

**¹⁰** Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return *and* be ashamed suddenly.
