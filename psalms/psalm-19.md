# Psalm 19

<sup>1</sup> The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. 

<sup>2</sup> Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. 

<sup>3</sup> *There is* no speech nor language, *where* their voice is not heard. 

<sup>4</sup> Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, 

<sup>5</sup> Which *is* as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, *and* rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race. 

<sup>6</sup> His going forth *is* from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. 

<sup>7</sup> The law of the LORD *is* perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD *is* sure, making wise the simple. 

<sup>8</sup> The statutes of the LORD *are* right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD *is* pure, enlightening the eyes. 

<sup>9</sup> The fear of the LORD *is* clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD *are* true *and* righteous altogether. 

<sup>10</sup> More to be desired *are they* than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. 

<sup>11</sup> Moreover by them is thy servant warned: *and* in keeping of them *there is* great reward. 

<sup>12</sup> Who can understand *his* errors? cleanse thou me from secret *faults*. 

<sup>13</sup> Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous *sins;* let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression. 

<sup>14</sup> Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.
