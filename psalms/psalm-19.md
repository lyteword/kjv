# Psalm 19

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. 

<sup>2</sup> Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. 

<sup>3</sup> There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. 

<sup>4</sup> Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, 

<sup>5</sup> Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race. 

<sup>6</sup> His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. 

<sup>7</sup> The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. 

<sup>8</sup> The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. 

<sup>9</sup> The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether. 

<sup>10</sup> More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. 

<sup>11</sup> Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward. 

<sup>12</sup> Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults. 

<sup>13</sup> Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression. 

<sup>14</sup> Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.
