# Psalm 111

**¹** Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with *my* whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and *in* the congregation. 

**²** The works of the LORD *are* great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. 

**³** His work *is* honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever. 

**⁴** He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD *is* gracious and full of compassion. 

**⁵** He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant. 

**⁶** He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen. 

**⁷** The works of his hands *are* verity and judgment; all his commandments *are* sure. 

**⁸** They stand fast for ever and ever, *and are* done in truth and uprightness. 

**⁹** He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend *is* his name. 

**¹⁰** The fear of the LORD *is* the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do *his commandments:* his praise endureth for ever.
