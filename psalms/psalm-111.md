# Psalm 111

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation. 

<sup>2</sup> The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. 

<sup>3</sup> His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever. 

<sup>4</sup> He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion. 

<sup>5</sup> He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant. 

<sup>6</sup> He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen. 

<sup>7</sup> The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure. 

<sup>8</sup> They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness. 

<sup>9</sup> He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name. 

<sup>10</sup> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.
