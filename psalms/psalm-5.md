# Psalm 5

<sup>1</sup> Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation. 

<sup>2</sup> Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray. 

<sup>3</sup> My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct *my prayer* unto thee, and will look up. 

<sup>4</sup> For thou *art* not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee. 

<sup>5</sup> The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity. 

<sup>6</sup> Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. 

<sup>7</sup> But as for me, I will come *into* thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: *and* in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple. 

<sup>8</sup> Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face. 

<sup>9</sup> For *there is* no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part *is* very wickedness; their throat *is* an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue. 

<sup>10</sup> Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee. 

<sup>11</sup> But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. 

<sup>12</sup> For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as *with* a shield.
