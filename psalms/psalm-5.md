# Psalm 5 

**¹** Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation. 

**²** Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray. 

**³** My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct *my prayer* unto thee, and will look up. 

**⁴** For thou *art* not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee. 

**⁵** The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity. 

**⁶** Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. 

**⁷** But as for me, I will come *into* thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: *and* in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple. 

**⁸** Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face. 

**⁹** For *there is* no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part *is* very wickedness; their throat *is* an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue. 

**¹⁰** Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee. 

**¹¹** But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. 

**¹²** For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as *with* a shield.
