# Psalm 4

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David. Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. 

<sup>2</sup> O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah. 

<sup>3</sup> But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him. 

<sup>4</sup> Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah. 

<sup>5</sup> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD. 

<sup>6</sup> There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. 

<sup>7</sup> Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased. 

<sup>8</sup> I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.
