# Psalm 4

<sup>1</sup> Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me *when I was* in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. 

<sup>2</sup> O ye sons of men, how long *will ye turn* my glory into shame? *how long* will ye love vanity, *and* seek after leasing? Selah. 

<sup>3</sup> But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him. 

<sup>4</sup> Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah. 

<sup>5</sup> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD. 

<sup>6</sup> *There be* many that say, Who will shew us *any* good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. 

<sup>7</sup> Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time *that* their corn and their wine increased. 

<sup>8</sup> I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.
