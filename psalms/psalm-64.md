# Psalm 64 

**¹** Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy. 

**²** Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity: 

**³** Who whet their tongue like a sword, *and* bend *their bows to shoot* their arrows, *even* bitter words: 

**⁴** That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. 

**⁵** They encourage themselves *in* an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them? 

**⁶** They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward *thought* of every one *of them*, and the heart, *is* deep. 

**⁷** But God shall shoot at them *with* an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded. 

**⁸** So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away. 

**⁹** And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing. 

**¹⁰** The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.
