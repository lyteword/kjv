# Psalm 64

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy. 

<sup>2</sup> Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity: 

<sup>3</sup> Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words: 

<sup>4</sup> That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. 

<sup>5</sup> They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them? 

<sup>6</sup> They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep. 

<sup>7</sup> But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded. 

<sup>8</sup> So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away. 

<sup>9</sup> And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing. 

<sup>10</sup> The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.
