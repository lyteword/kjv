# Psalm 135 

**¹** Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise *him*, O ye servants of the LORD. 

**²** Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God, 

**³** Praise the LORD; for the LORD *is* good: sing praises unto his name; for *it is* pleasant. 

**⁴** For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, *and* Israel for his peculiar treasure. 

**⁵** For I know that the LORD *is* great, and *that* our Lord *is* above all gods. 

**⁶** Whatsoever the LORD pleased, *that* did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places. 

**⁷** He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries. 

**⁸** Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast. 

**⁹** *Who* sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants. 

**¹⁰** Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings; 

**¹¹** Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan: 

**¹²** And gave their land *for* an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people. 

**¹³** Thy name, O LORD, *endureth* for ever; *and* thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations. 

**¹⁴** For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants. 

**¹⁵** The idols of the heathen *are* silver and gold, the work of men’s hands. 

**¹⁶** They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not; 

**¹⁷** They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there *any* breath in their mouths. 

**¹⁸** They that make them are like unto them: *so is* every one that trusteth in them. 

**¹⁹** Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron: 

**²⁰** Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD. 

**²¹** Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
