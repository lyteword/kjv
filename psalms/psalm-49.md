# Psalm 49

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah. Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world: 

<sup>2</sup> Both low and high, rich and poor, together. 

<sup>3</sup> My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. 

<sup>4</sup> I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp. 

<sup>5</sup> Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about? 

<sup>6</sup> They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; 

<sup>7</sup> None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: 

<sup>8</sup> (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:) 

<sup>9</sup> That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption. 

<sup>10</sup> For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others. 

<sup>11</sup> Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names. 

<sup>12</sup> Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish. 

<sup>13</sup> This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah. 

<sup>14</sup> Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling. 

<sup>15</sup> But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah. 

<sup>16</sup> Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased; 

<sup>17</sup> For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him. 

<sup>18</sup> Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself. 

<sup>19</sup> He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light. 

<sup>20</sup> Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.
