# Psalm 49

**¹** Hear this, all *ye* people; give ear, all *ye* inhabitants of the world: 

**²** Both low and high, rich and poor, together. 

**³** My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart *shall be* of understanding. 

**⁴** I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp. 

**⁵** Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, *when* the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about? 

**⁶** They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; 

**⁷** None *of them* can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: 

**⁸** (For the redemption of their soul *is* precious, and it ceaseth for ever:) 

**⁹** That he should still live for ever, *and* not see corruption. 

**¹⁰** For he seeth *that* wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others. 

**¹¹** Their inward thought *is, that* their houses *shall continue* for ever, *and* their dwelling places to all generations; they call *their* lands after their own names. 

**¹²** Nevertheless man *being* in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts *that* perish. 

**¹³** This their way *is* their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah. 

**¹⁴** Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling. 

**¹⁵** But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah. 

**¹⁶** Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased; 

**¹⁷** For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him. 

**¹⁸** Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and *men* will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself. 

**¹⁹** He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light. 

**²⁰** Man *that is* in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts *that* perish.
