# Psalm 24

**¹** The earth *is* the LORD’s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. 

**²** For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods. 

**³** Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place? 

**⁴** He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. 

**⁵** He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. 

**⁶** This *is* the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah. 

**⁷** Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. 

**⁸** Who *is* this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle. 

**⁹** Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift *them* up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. 

**¹⁰** Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he *is* the King of glory. Selah.
