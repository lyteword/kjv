# Psalm 82

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of Asaph. God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. 

<sup>2</sup> How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. 

<sup>3</sup> Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. 

<sup>4</sup> Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked. 

<sup>5</sup> They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course. 

<sup>6</sup> I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. 

<sup>7</sup> But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. 

<sup>8</sup> Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.
