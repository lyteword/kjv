# Psalm 82

**¹** God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. 

**²** How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. 

**³** Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. 

**⁴** Deliver the poor and needy: rid *them* out of the hand of the wicked. 

**⁵** They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course. 

**⁶** I have said, Ye *are* gods; and all of you *are* children of the most High. 

**⁷** But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. 

**⁸** Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.
