# Psalm 41 

**¹** Blessed *is* he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble. 

**²** The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; *and* he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies. 

**³** The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness. 

**⁴** I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee. 

**⁵** Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish? 

**⁶** And if he come to see *me*, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; *when* he goeth abroad, he telleth *it*. 

**⁷** All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt. 

**⁸** An evil disease, *say they*, cleaveth fast unto him: and *now* that he lieth he shall rise up no more. 

**⁹** Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up *his* heel against me. 

**¹⁰** But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them. 

**¹¹** By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me. 

**¹²** And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever. 

**¹³** Blessed *be* the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.
