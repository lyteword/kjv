# Psalm 13 

**¹** How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? 

**²** How long shall I take counsel in my soul, *having* sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me? 

**³** Consider *and* hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the *sleep of* death; 

**⁴** Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; *and* those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved. 

**⁵** But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. 

**⁶** I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
