# Psalm 121 

**¹** I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. 

**²** My help *cometh* from the LORD, which made heaven and earth. 

**³** He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber. 

**⁴** Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. 

**⁵** The LORD *is* thy keeper: the LORD *is* thy shade upon thy right hand. 

**⁶** The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. 

**⁷** The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. 

**⁸** The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.
