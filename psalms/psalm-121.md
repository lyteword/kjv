# Psalm 121

<sup>1</sup> A Song of degrees. I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. 

<sup>2</sup> My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth. 

<sup>3</sup> He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber. 

<sup>4</sup> Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. 

<sup>5</sup> The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand. 

<sup>6</sup> The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. 

<sup>7</sup> The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. 

<sup>8</sup> The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.
