# Psalm 149

**¹** Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, *and* his praise in the congregation of saints. 

**²** Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. 

**³** Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp. 

**⁴** For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation. 

**⁵** Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds. 

**⁶** *Let* the high *praises* of God *be* in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand; 

**⁷** To execute vengeance upon the heathen, *and* punishments upon the people; 

**⁸** To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; 

**⁹** To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.
