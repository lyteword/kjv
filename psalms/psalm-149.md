# Psalm 149

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, *and* his praise in the congregation of saints. 

<sup>2</sup> Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. 

<sup>3</sup> Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp. 

<sup>4</sup> For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation. 

<sup>5</sup> Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds. 

<sup>6</sup> *Let* the high *praises* of God *be* in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand; 

<sup>7</sup> To execute vengeance upon the heathen, *and* punishments upon the people; 

<sup>8</sup> To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; 

<sup>9</sup> To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.
