# Psalm 89

<sup>1</sup> Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations. 

<sup>2</sup> For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens. 

<sup>3</sup> I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant, 

<sup>4</sup> Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah. 

<sup>5</sup> And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints. 

<sup>6</sup> For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD? 

<sup>7</sup> God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him. 

<sup>8</sup> O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee? 

<sup>9</sup> Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them. 

<sup>10</sup> Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm. 

<sup>11</sup> The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them. 

<sup>12</sup> The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name. 

<sup>13</sup> Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand. 

<sup>14</sup> Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face. 

<sup>15</sup> Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance. 

<sup>16</sup> In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted. 

<sup>17</sup> For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted. 

<sup>18</sup> For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king. 

<sup>19</sup> Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people. 

<sup>20</sup> I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him: 

<sup>21</sup> With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him. 

<sup>22</sup> The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him. 

<sup>23</sup> And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him. 

<sup>24</sup> But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted. 

<sup>25</sup> I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers. 

<sup>26</sup> He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation. 

<sup>27</sup> Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth. 

<sup>28</sup> My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him. 

<sup>29</sup> His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven. 

<sup>30</sup> If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; 

<sup>31</sup> If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; 

<sup>32</sup> Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. 

<sup>33</sup> Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. 

<sup>34</sup> My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. 

<sup>35</sup> Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David. 

<sup>36</sup> His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. 

<sup>37</sup> It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah. 

<sup>38</sup> But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed. 

<sup>39</sup> Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground. 

<sup>40</sup> Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin. 

<sup>41</sup> All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours. 

<sup>42</sup> Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice. 

<sup>43</sup> Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle. 

<sup>44</sup> Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground. 

<sup>45</sup> The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah. 

<sup>46</sup> How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire? 

<sup>47</sup> Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain? 

<sup>48</sup> What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah. 

<sup>49</sup> Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth? 

<sup>50</sup> Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people; 

<sup>51</sup> Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed. 

<sup>52</sup> Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.
