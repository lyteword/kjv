# Psalm 144 

**¹** Blessed *be* the LORD my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, *and* my fingers to fight: 

**²** My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and *he* in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me. 

**³** LORD, what *is* man, that thou takest knowledge of him! *or* the son of man, that thou makest account of him! 

**⁴** Man is like to vanity: his days *are* as a shadow that passeth away. 

**⁵** Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke. 

**⁶** Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them. 

**⁷** Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children; 

**⁸** Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand *is* a right hand of falsehood. 

**⁹** I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery *and* an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee. 

**¹⁰** *It is he* that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword. 

**¹¹** Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand *is* a right hand of falsehood: 

**¹²** That our sons *may be* as plants grown up in their youth; *that* our daughters *may be* as corner stones, polished *after* the similitude of a palace: 

**¹³** *That* our garners *may be* full, affording all manner of store: *that* our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets: 

**¹⁴** *That* our oxen *may be* strong to labour; *that there be* no breaking in, nor going out; that *there be* no complaining in our streets. 

**¹⁵** Happy *is that* people, that is in such a case: *yea*, happy *is that* people, whose God *is* the LORD.
