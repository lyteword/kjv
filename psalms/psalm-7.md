# Psalm 7

<sup>1</sup> Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite. O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me: 

<sup>2</sup> Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. 

<sup>3</sup> O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands; 

<sup>4</sup> If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:) 

<sup>5</sup> Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah. 

<sup>6</sup> Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded. 

<sup>7</sup> So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high. 

<sup>8</sup> The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me. 

<sup>9</sup> Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins. 

<sup>10</sup> My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart. 

<sup>11</sup> God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day. 

<sup>12</sup> If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready. 

<sup>13</sup> He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors. 

<sup>14</sup> Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood. 

<sup>15</sup> He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made. 

<sup>16</sup> His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate. 

<sup>17</sup> I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.
