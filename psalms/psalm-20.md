# Psalm 20

**¹** The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee; 

**²** Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion; 

**³** Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah. 

**⁴** Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel. 

**⁵** We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up *our* banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions. 

**⁶** Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand. 

**⁷** Some *trust* in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God. 

**⁸** They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright. 

**⁹** Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.
