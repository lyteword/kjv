# Psalm 132

<sup>1</sup> A Song of degrees. LORD, remember David, and all his afflictions: 

<sup>2</sup> How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob; 

<sup>3</sup> Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed; 

<sup>4</sup> I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, 

<sup>5</sup> Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob. 

<sup>6</sup> Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood. 

<sup>7</sup> We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool. 

<sup>8</sup> Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength. 

<sup>9</sup> Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy. 

<sup>10</sup> For thy servant Davidâ€™s sake turn not away the face of thine anointed. 

<sup>11</sup> The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. 

<sup>12</sup> If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore. 

<sup>13</sup> For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. 

<sup>14</sup> This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it. 

<sup>15</sup> I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread. 

<sup>16</sup> I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy. 

<sup>17</sup> There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed. 

<sup>18</sup> His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.
