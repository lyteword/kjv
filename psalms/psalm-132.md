# Psalm 132 

**¹** LORD, remember David, *and* all his afflictions: 

**²** How he sware unto the LORD, *and* vowed unto the mighty *God* of Jacob; 

**³** Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed; 

**⁴** I will not give sleep to mine eyes, *or* slumber to mine eyelids, 

**⁵** Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty *God* of Jacob. 

**⁶** Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood. 

**⁷** We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool. 

**⁸** Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength. 

**⁹** Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy. 

**¹⁰** For thy servant David’s sake turn not away the face of thine anointed. 

**¹¹** The LORD hath sworn *in* truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. 

**¹²** If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore. 

**¹³** For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired *it* for his habitation. 

**¹⁴** This *is* my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it. 

**¹⁵** I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread. 

**¹⁶** I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy. 

**¹⁷** There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed. 

**¹⁸** His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.
