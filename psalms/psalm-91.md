# Psalm 91

<sup>1</sup> He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. 

<sup>2</sup> I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. 

<sup>3</sup> Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. 

<sup>4</sup> He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler. 

<sup>5</sup> Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; 

<sup>6</sup> Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. 

<sup>7</sup> A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. 

<sup>8</sup> Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. 

<sup>9</sup> Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; 

<sup>10</sup> There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. 

<sup>11</sup> For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. 

<sup>12</sup> They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. 

<sup>13</sup> Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet. 

<sup>14</sup> Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. 

<sup>15</sup> He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him. 

<sup>16</sup> With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
