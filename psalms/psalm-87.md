# Psalm 87 

**¹** His foundation *is* in the holy mountains. 

**²** The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. 

**³** Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah. 

**⁴** I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this *man* was born there. 

**⁵** And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her. 

**⁶** The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, *that* this *man* was born there. Selah. 

**⁷** As well the singers as the players on instruments *shall be there:* all my springs *are* in thee.
