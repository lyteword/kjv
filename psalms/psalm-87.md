# Psalm 87

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm or Song for the sons of Korah. His foundation is in the holy mountains. 

<sup>2</sup> The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. 

<sup>3</sup> Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah. 

<sup>4</sup> I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there. 

<sup>5</sup> And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her. 

<sup>6</sup> The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah. 

<sup>7</sup> As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee.
