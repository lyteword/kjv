# Psalm 118

<sup>1</sup> O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever. 

<sup>2</sup> Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 

<sup>3</sup> Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 

<sup>4</sup> Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 

<sup>5</sup> I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and set me in a large place. 

<sup>6</sup> The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me? 

<sup>7</sup> The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me. 

<sup>8</sup> It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man. 

<sup>9</sup> It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes. 

<sup>10</sup> All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them. 

<sup>11</sup> They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them. 

<sup>12</sup> They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them. 

<sup>13</sup> Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me. 

<sup>14</sup> The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation. 

<sup>15</sup> The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. 

<sup>16</sup> The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. 

<sup>17</sup> I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD. 

<sup>18</sup> The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death. 

<sup>19</sup> Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD: 

<sup>20</sup> This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter. 

<sup>21</sup> I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation. 

<sup>22</sup> The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner. 

<sup>23</sup> This is the LORDâ€™s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes. 

<sup>24</sup> This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. 

<sup>25</sup> Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity. 

<sup>26</sup> Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD. 

<sup>27</sup> God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar. 

<sup>28</sup> Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee. 

<sup>29</sup> O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
