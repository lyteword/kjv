# Psalm 118 

**¹** O give thanks unto the LORD; for *he is* good: because his mercy *endureth* for ever. 

**²** Let Israel now say, that his mercy *endureth* for ever. 

**³** Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy *endureth* for ever. 

**⁴** Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy *endureth* for ever. 

**⁵** I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, *and set me* in a large place. 

**⁶** The LORD *is* on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me? 

**⁷** The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see *my desire* upon them that hate me. 

**⁸** *It is* better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man. 

**⁹** *It is* better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes. 

**¹⁰** All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them. 

**¹¹** They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them. 

**¹²** They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them. 

**¹³** Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me. 

**¹⁴** The LORD *is* my strength and song, and is become my salvation. 

**¹⁵** The voice of rejoicing and salvation *is* in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. 

**¹⁶** The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. 

**¹⁷** I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD. 

**¹⁸** The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death. 

**¹⁹** Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, *and* I will praise the LORD: 

**²⁰** This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter. 

**²¹** I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation. 

**²²** The stone *which* the builders refused is become the head *stone* of the corner. 

**²³** This is the LORD’s doing; it *is* marvellous in our eyes. 

**²⁴** This *is* the day *which* the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. 

**²⁵** Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity. 

**²⁶** Blessed *be* he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD. 

**²⁷** God *is* the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, *even* unto the horns of the altar. 

**²⁸** Thou *art* my God, and I will praise thee: *thou art* my God, I will exalt thee. 

**²⁹** O give thanks unto the LORD; for *he is* good: for his mercy *endureth* for ever.
