# Psalm 86 

**¹** Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I *am* poor and needy. 

**²** Preserve my soul; for I *am* holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee. 

**³** Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily. 

**⁴** Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. 

**⁵** For thou, Lord, *art* good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee. 

**⁶** Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications. 

**⁷** In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me. 

**⁸** Among the gods *there is* none like unto thee, O Lord; neither *are there any works* like unto thy works. 

**⁹** All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name. 

**¹⁰** For thou *art* great, and doest wondrous things: thou *art* God alone. 

**¹¹** Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name. 

**¹²** I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore. 

**¹³** For great *is* thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell. 

**¹⁴** O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent *men* have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them. 

**¹⁵** But thou, O Lord, *art* a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth. 

**¹⁶** O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid. 

**¹⁷** Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see *it*, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.
