# Psalm 86

<sup>1</sup> Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I *am* poor and needy. 

<sup>2</sup> Preserve my soul; for I *am* holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee. 

<sup>3</sup> Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily. 

<sup>4</sup> Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. 

<sup>5</sup> For thou, Lord, *art* good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee. 

<sup>6</sup> Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications. 

<sup>7</sup> In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me. 

<sup>8</sup> Among the gods *there is* none like unto thee, O Lord; neither *are there any works* like unto thy works. 

<sup>9</sup> All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name. 

<sup>10</sup> For thou *art* great, and doest wondrous things: thou *art* God alone. 

<sup>11</sup> Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name. 

<sup>12</sup> I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore. 

<sup>13</sup> For great *is* thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell. 

<sup>14</sup> O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent *men* have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them. 

<sup>15</sup> But thou, O Lord, *art* a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth. 

<sup>16</sup> O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid. 

<sup>17</sup> Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see *it*, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.
