# Psalm 11

<sup>1</sup> In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee *as* a bird to your mountain? 

<sup>2</sup> For, lo, the wicked bend *their* bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart. 

<sup>3</sup> If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? 

<sup>4</sup> The LORD *is* in his holy temple, the LORD’s throne *is* in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. 

<sup>5</sup> The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. 

<sup>6</sup> Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: *this shall be* the portion of their cup. 

<sup>7</sup> For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.
