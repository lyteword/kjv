# Psalm 11 

**¹** In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee *as* a bird to your mountain? 

**²** For, lo, the wicked bend *their* bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart. 

**³** If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? 

**⁴** The LORD *is* in his holy temple, the LORD’s throne *is* in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. 

**⁵** The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. 

**⁶** Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: *this shall be* the portion of their cup. 

**⁷** For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.
