# Psalm 130 

**¹** Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD. 

**²** Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. 

**³** If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? 

**⁴** But *there is* forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. 

**⁵** I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. 

**⁶** My soul *waiteth* for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: *I say, more than* they that watch for the morning. 

**⁷** Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD *there is* mercy, and with him *is* plenteous redemption. 

**⁸** And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
