# Psalm 122 

**¹** I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD. 

**²** Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem. 

**³** Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together: 

**⁴** Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD. 

**⁵** For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David. 

**⁶** Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee. 

**⁷** Peace be within thy walls, *and* prosperity within thy palaces. 

**⁸** For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace *be* within thee. 

**⁹** Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
