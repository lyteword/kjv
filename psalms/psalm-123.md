# Psalm 123 

**¹** Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. 

**²** Behold, as the eyes of servants *look* unto the hand of their masters, *and* as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes *wait* upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us. 

**³** Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt. 

**⁴** Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, *and* with the contempt of the proud.
