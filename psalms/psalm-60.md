# Psalm 60 

**¹** O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again. 

**²** Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh. 

**³** Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment. 

**⁴** Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah. 

**⁵** That thy beloved may be delivered; save *with* thy right hand, and hear me. 

**⁶** God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 

**⁷** Gilead *is* mine, and Manasseh *is* mine; Ephraim also *is* the strength of mine head; Judah *is* my lawgiver; 

**⁸** Moab *is* my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me. 

**⁹** Who will bring me *into* the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? 

**¹⁰** *Wilt* not thou, O God, *which* hadst cast us off? and *thou*, O God, *which* didst not go out with our armies? 

**¹¹** Give us help from trouble: for vain *is* the help of man. 

**¹²** Through God we shall do valiantly: for he *it is that* shall tread down our enemies.
