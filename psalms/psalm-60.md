# Psalm 60

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician upon Shushan-eduth, Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, when Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the valley of salt twelve thousand. O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again. 

<sup>2</sup> Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh. 

<sup>3</sup> Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment. 

<sup>4</sup> Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah. 

<sup>5</sup> That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me. 

<sup>6</sup> God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 

<sup>7</sup> Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver; 

<sup>8</sup> Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me. 

<sup>9</sup> Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? 

<sup>10</sup> Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies? 

<sup>11</sup> Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. 

<sup>12</sup> Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
