# Psalm 47

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah. O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph. 

<sup>2</sup> For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth. 

<sup>3</sup> He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet. 

<sup>4</sup> He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah. 

<sup>5</sup> God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet. 

<sup>6</sup> Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises. 

<sup>7</sup> For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding. 

<sup>8</sup> God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness. 

<sup>9</sup> The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.
