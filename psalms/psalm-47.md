# Psalm 47

**¹** O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph. 

**²** For the LORD most high *is* terrible; *he is* a great King over all the earth. 

**³** He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet. 

**⁴** He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah. 

**⁵** God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet. 

**⁶** Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises. 

**⁷** For God *is* the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding. 

**⁸** God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness. 

**⁹** The princes of the people are gathered together, *even* the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth *belong* unto God: he is greatly exalted.
