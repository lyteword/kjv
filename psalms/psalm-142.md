# Psalm 142

<sup>1</sup> I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication. 

<sup>2</sup> I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble. 

<sup>3</sup> When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me. 

<sup>4</sup> I looked on *my* right hand, and beheld, but *there was* no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. 

<sup>5</sup> I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou *art* my refuge *and* my portion in the land of the living. 

<sup>6</sup> Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. 

<sup>7</sup> Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
