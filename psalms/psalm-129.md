# Psalm 129 

**¹** Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say: 

**²** Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me. 

**³** The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows. 

**⁴** The LORD *is* righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. 

**⁵** Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion. 

**⁶** Let them be as the grass *upon* the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up: 

**⁷** Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom. 

**⁸** Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD *be* upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.
