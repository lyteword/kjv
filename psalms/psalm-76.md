# Psalm 76

**¹** In Judah *is* God known: his name *is* great in Israel. 

**²** In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion. 

**³** There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah. 

**⁴** Thou *art* more glorious *and* excellent than the mountains of prey. 

**⁵** The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands. 

**⁶** At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep. 

**⁷** Thou, *even* thou, *art* to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry? 

**⁸** Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still, 

**⁹** When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah. 

**¹⁰** Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain. 

**¹¹** Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. 

**¹²** He shall cut off the spirit of princes: *he is* terrible to the kings of the earth.
