# Psalm 76

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm or Song of Asaph. In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel. 

<sup>2</sup> In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion. 

<sup>3</sup> There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah. 

<sup>4</sup> Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey. 

<sup>5</sup> The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands. 

<sup>6</sup> At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep. 

<sup>7</sup> Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry? 

<sup>8</sup> Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still, 

<sup>9</sup> When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah. 

<sup>10</sup> Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain. 

<sup>11</sup> Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. 

<sup>12</sup> He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.
