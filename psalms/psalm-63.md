# Psalm 63 

**¹** O God, thou *art* my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is; 

**²** To see thy power and thy glory, so *as* I have seen thee in the sanctuary. 

**³** Because thy lovingkindness *is* better than life, my lips shall praise thee. 

**⁴** Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name. 

**⁵** My soul shall be satisfied as *with* marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise *thee* with joyful lips: 

**⁶** When I remember thee upon my bed, *and* meditate on thee in the *night* watches. 

**⁷** Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. 

**⁸** My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me. 

**⁹** But those *that* seek my soul, to destroy *it*, shall go into the lower parts of the earth. 

**¹⁰** They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes. 

**¹¹** But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
