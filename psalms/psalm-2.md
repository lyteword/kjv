# Psalm 2

<sup>1</sup> Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? 

<sup>2</sup> The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying, 

<sup>3</sup> Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. 

<sup>4</sup> He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. 

<sup>5</sup> Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. 

<sup>6</sup> Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. 

<sup>7</sup> I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee. 

<sup>8</sup> Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. 

<sup>9</sup> Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potterâ€™s vessel. 

<sup>10</sup> Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. 

<sup>11</sup> Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. 

<sup>12</sup> Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
