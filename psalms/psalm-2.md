# Psalm 2

**¹** Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? 

**²** The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, *saying*, 

**³** Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. 

**⁴** He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. 

**⁵** Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. 

**⁶** Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. 

**⁷** I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou *art* my Son; this day have I begotten thee. 

**⁸** Ask of me, and I shall give *thee* the heathen *for* thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth *for* thy possession. 

**⁹** Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel. 

**¹⁰** Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. 

**¹¹** Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. 

**¹²** Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish *from* the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed *are* all they that put their trust in him.
