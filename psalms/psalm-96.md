# Psalm 96

**¹** O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth. 

**²** Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day. 

**³** Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people. 

**⁴** For the LORD *is* great, and greatly to be praised: he *is* to be feared above all gods. 

**⁵** For all the gods of the nations *are* idols: but the LORD made the heavens. 

**⁶** Honour and majesty *are* before him: strength and beauty *are* in his sanctuary. 

**⁷** Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 

**⁸** Give unto the LORD the glory *due unto* his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts. 

**⁹** O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth. 

**¹⁰** Say among the heathen *that* the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously. 

**¹¹** Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof. 

**¹²** Let the field be joyful, and all that *is* therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice 

**¹³** Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.
