# Psalm 96

<sup>1</sup> O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth. 

<sup>2</sup> Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day. 

<sup>3</sup> Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people. 

<sup>4</sup> For the LORD *is* great, and greatly to be praised: he *is* to be feared above all gods. 

<sup>5</sup> For all the gods of the nations *are* idols: but the LORD made the heavens. 

<sup>6</sup> Honour and majesty *are* before him: strength and beauty *are* in his sanctuary. 

<sup>7</sup> Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 

<sup>8</sup> Give unto the LORD the glory *due unto* his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts. 

<sup>9</sup> O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> Say among the heathen *that* the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously. 

<sup>11</sup> Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof. 

<sup>12</sup> Let the field be joyful, and all that *is* therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice 

<sup>13</sup> Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.
