# Psalm 68

<sup>1</sup> Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him. 

<sup>2</sup> As smoke is driven away, *so* drive *them* away: as wax melteth before the fire, *so* let the wicked perish at the presence of God. 

<sup>3</sup> But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice. 

<sup>4</sup> Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name Jah, and rejoice before him. 

<sup>5</sup> A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, *is* God in his holy habitation. 

<sup>6</sup> God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry *land*. 

<sup>7</sup> O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah: 

<sup>8</sup> The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: *even* Sinai itself *was moved* at the presence of God, the God of Israel. 

<sup>9</sup> Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary. 

<sup>10</sup> Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor. 

<sup>11</sup> The Lord gave the word: great *was* the company of those that published *it*. 

<sup>12</sup> Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil. 

<sup>13</sup> Though ye have lien among the pots, *yet shall ye be as* the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold. 

<sup>14</sup> When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was *white* as snow in Salmon. 

<sup>15</sup> The hill of God *is as* the hill of Bashan; an high hill *as* the hill of Bashan. 

<sup>16</sup> Why leap ye, ye high hills? *this is* the hill *which* God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell *in it* for ever. 

<sup>17</sup> The chariots of God *are* twenty thousand, *even* thousands of angels: the Lord *is* among them, *as in* Sinai, in the holy *place*. 

<sup>18</sup> Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, *for* the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell *among them*. 

<sup>19</sup> Blessed *be* the Lord, *who* daily loadeth us *with benefits, even* the God of our salvation. Selah. 

<sup>20</sup> *He that is* our God *is* the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord *belong* the issues from death. 

<sup>21</sup> But God shall wound the head of his enemies, *and* the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses. 

<sup>22</sup> The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring *my people* again from the depths of the sea: 

<sup>23</sup> That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of *thine* enemies, *and* the tongue of thy dogs in the same. 

<sup>24</sup> They have seen thy goings, O God; *even* the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary. 

<sup>25</sup> The singers went before, the players on instruments *followed* after; among *them were* the damsels playing with timbrels. 

<sup>26</sup> Bless ye God in the congregations, *even* the Lord, from the fountain of Israel. 

<sup>27</sup> There *is* little Benjamin *with* their ruler, the princes of Judah *and* their council, the princes of Zebulun, *and* the princes of Naphtali. 

<sup>28</sup> Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us. 

<sup>29</sup> Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee. 

<sup>30</sup> Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, *till every one* submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people *that* delight in war. 

<sup>31</sup> Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God. 

<sup>32</sup> Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah: 

<sup>33</sup> To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, *which were* of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, *and that* a mighty voice. 

<sup>34</sup> Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency *is* over Israel, and his strength *is* in the clouds. 

<sup>35</sup> O God, *thou art* terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel *is* he that giveth strength and power unto *his* people. Blessed *be* God.
