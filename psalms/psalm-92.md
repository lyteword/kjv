# Psalm 92 

**¹** *It is a* good *thing* to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High: 

**²** To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night, 

**³** Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound. 

**⁴** For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands. 

**⁵** O LORD, how great are thy works! *and* thy thoughts are very deep. 

**⁶** A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this. 

**⁷** When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; *it is* that they shall be destroyed for ever: 

**⁸** But thou, LORD, *art most* high for evermore. 

**⁹** For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. 

**¹⁰** But my horn shalt thou exalt like *the horn of* an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil. 

**¹¹** Mine eye also shall see *my desire* on mine enemies, *and* mine ears shall hear *my desire* of the wicked that rise up against me. 

**¹²** The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 

**¹³** Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God. 

**¹⁴** They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing; 

**¹⁵** To shew that the LORD *is* upright: *he is* my rock, and *there is* no unrighteousness in him.
