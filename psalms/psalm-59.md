# Psalm 59 

**¹** Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me. 

**²** Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men. 

**³** For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not *for* my transgression, nor *for* my sin, O LORD. 

**⁴** They run and prepare themselves without *my* fault: awake to help me, and behold. 

**⁵** Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah. 

**⁶** They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. 

**⁷** Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords *are* in their lips: for who, *say they*, doth hear? 

**⁸** But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision. 

**⁹** *Because of* his strength will I wait upon thee: for God *is* my defence. 

**¹⁰** The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see *my desire* upon mine enemies. 

**¹¹** Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield. 

**¹²** *For* the sin of their mouth *and* the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying *which* they speak. 

**¹³** Consume *them* in wrath, consume *them*, that they *may* not *be:* and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah. 

**¹⁴** And at evening let them return; *and* let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. 

**¹⁵** Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied. 

**¹⁶** But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble. 

**¹⁷** Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God *is* my defence, *and* the God of my mercy.
