# Psalm 139

<sup>1</sup> O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known *me*. 

<sup>2</sup> Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. 

<sup>3</sup> Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted *with* all my ways. 

<sup>4</sup> For *there is* not a word in my tongue, *but*, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether. 

<sup>5</sup> Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me. 

<sup>6</sup> *Such* knowledge *is* too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot *attain* unto it. 

<sup>7</sup> Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? 

<sup>8</sup> If I ascend up into heaven, thou *art* there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou *art there*. 

<sup>9</sup> *If* I take the wings of the morning, *and* dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; 

<sup>10</sup> Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. 

<sup>11</sup> If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me. 

<sup>12</sup> Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light *are* both alike *to thee*. 

<sup>13</sup> For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother’s womb. 

<sup>14</sup> I will praise thee; for I am fearfully *and* wonderfully made: marvellous *are* thy works; and *that* my soul knoweth right well. 

<sup>15</sup> My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, *and* curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. 

<sup>16</sup> Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all *my members* were written, *which* in continuance were fashioned, when *as yet there was* none of them. 

<sup>17</sup> How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! 

<sup>18</sup> *If* I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee. 

<sup>19</sup> Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men. 

<sup>20</sup> For they speak against thee wickedly, *and* thine enemies take *thy name* in vain. 

<sup>21</sup> Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? 

<sup>22</sup> I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies. 

<sup>23</sup> Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: 

<sup>24</sup> And see if *there be any* wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
