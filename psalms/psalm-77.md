# Psalm 77

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph. I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me. 

<sup>2</sup> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted. 

<sup>3</sup> I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah. 

<sup>4</sup> Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. 

<sup>5</sup> I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. 

<sup>6</sup> I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search. 

<sup>7</sup> Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? 

<sup>8</sup> Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore? 

<sup>9</sup> Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah. 

<sup>10</sup> And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High. 

<sup>11</sup> I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old. 

<sup>12</sup> I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings. 

<sup>13</sup> Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God? 

<sup>14</sup> Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people. 

<sup>15</sup> Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. 

<sup>16</sup> The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled. 

<sup>17</sup> The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad. 

<sup>18</sup> The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook. 

<sup>19</sup> Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known. 

<sup>20</sup> Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
