# Psalm 77 

**¹** I cried unto God with my voice, *even* unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me. 

**²** In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted. 

**³** I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah. 

**⁴** Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. 

**⁵** I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. 

**⁶** I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search. 

**⁷** Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? 

**⁸** Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth *his* promise fail for evermore? 

**⁹** Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah. 

**¹⁰** And I said, This *is* my infirmity: *but I will remember* the years of the right hand of the most High. 

**¹¹** I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old. 

**¹²** I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings. 

**¹³** Thy way, O God, *is* in the sanctuary: who *is so* great a God as *our* God? 

**¹⁴** Thou *art* the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people. 

**¹⁵** Thou hast with *thine* arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. 

**¹⁶** The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled. 

**¹⁷** The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad. 

**¹⁸** The voice of thy thunder *was* in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook. 

**¹⁹** Thy way *is* in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known. 

**²⁰** Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
