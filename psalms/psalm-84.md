# Psalm 84

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm for the sons of Korah. How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts! 

<sup>2</sup> My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. 

<sup>3</sup> Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God. 

<sup>4</sup> Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah. 

<sup>5</sup> Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them. 

<sup>6</sup> Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools. 

<sup>7</sup> They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God. 

<sup>8</sup> O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah. 

<sup>9</sup> Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed. 

<sup>10</sup> For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. 

<sup>11</sup> For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. 

<sup>12</sup> O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
