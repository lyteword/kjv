# Psalm 84 

**¹** How amiable *are* thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts! 

**²** My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. 

**³** Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, *even* thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God. 

**⁴** Blessed *are* they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah. 

**⁵** Blessed *is* the man whose strength *is* in thee; in whose heart *are* the ways *of them*. 

**⁶** *Who* passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools. 

**⁷** They go from strength to strength, *every one of them* in Zion appeareth before God. 

**⁸** O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah. 

**⁹** Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed. 

**¹⁰** For a day in thy courts *is* better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. 

**¹¹** For the LORD God *is* a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good *thing* will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. 

**¹²** O LORD of hosts, blessed *is* the man that trusteth in thee.
