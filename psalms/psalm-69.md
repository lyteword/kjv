# Psalm 69

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, A Psalm of David. Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul. 

<sup>2</sup> I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. 

<sup>3</sup> I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. 

<sup>4</sup> They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away. 

<sup>5</sup> O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee. 

<sup>6</sup> Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel. 

<sup>7</sup> Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face. 

<sup>8</sup> I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my motherâ€™s children. 

<sup>9</sup> For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me. 

<sup>10</sup> When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach. 

<sup>11</sup> I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them. 

<sup>12</sup> They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards. 

<sup>13</sup> But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation. 

<sup>14</sup> Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters. 

<sup>15</sup> Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me. 

<sup>16</sup> Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies. 

<sup>17</sup> And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily. 

<sup>18</sup> Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies. 

<sup>19</sup> Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee. 

<sup>20</sup> Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none. 

<sup>21</sup> They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. 

<sup>22</sup> Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap. 

<sup>23</sup> Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake. 

<sup>24</sup> Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them. 

<sup>25</sup> Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents. 

<sup>26</sup> For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded. 

<sup>27</sup> Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness. 

<sup>28</sup> Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous. 

<sup>29</sup> But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high. 

<sup>30</sup> I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. 

<sup>31</sup> This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs. 

<sup>32</sup> The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God. 

<sup>33</sup> For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners. 

<sup>34</sup> Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein. 

<sup>35</sup> For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession. 

<sup>36</sup> The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
