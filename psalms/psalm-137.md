# Psalm 137

<sup>1</sup> By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. 

<sup>2</sup> We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. 

<sup>3</sup> For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. 

<sup>4</sup> How shall we sing the LORDâ€™s song in a strange land? 

<sup>5</sup> If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. 

<sup>6</sup> If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. 

<sup>7</sup> Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof. 

<sup>8</sup> O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. 

<sup>9</sup> Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.
