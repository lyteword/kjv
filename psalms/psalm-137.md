# Psalm 137 

**¹** By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. 

**²** We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. 

**³** For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us *required of us* mirth, *saying*, Sing us *one* of the songs of Zion. 

**⁴** How shall we sing the LORD’s song in a strange land? 

**⁵** If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget *her cunning*. 

**⁶** If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. 

**⁷** Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase *it*, rase *it, even* to the foundation thereof. 

**⁸** O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy *shall he be*, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. 

**⁹** Happy *shall he be*, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.
