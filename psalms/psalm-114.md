# Psalm 114

**¹** When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; 

**²** Judah was his sanctuary, *and* Israel his dominion. 

**³** The sea saw *it*, and fled: Jordan was driven back. 

**⁴** The mountains skipped like rams, *and* the little hills like lambs. 

**⁵** What *ailed* thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, *that* thou wast driven back? 

**⁶** Ye mountains, *that* ye skipped like rams; *and* ye little hills, like lambs? 

**⁷** Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; 

**⁸** Which turned the rock *into* a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
