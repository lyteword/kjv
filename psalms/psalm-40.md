# Psalm 40 

**¹** I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. 

**²** He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, *and* established my goings. 

**³** And he hath put a new song in my mouth, *even* praise unto our God: many shall see *it*, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD. 

**⁴** Blessed *is* that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies. 

**⁵** Many, O LORD my God, *are* thy wonderful works *which* thou hast done, and thy thoughts *which are* to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: *if* I would declare and speak *of them*, they are more than can be numbered. 

**⁶** Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. 

**⁷** Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book *it is* written of me, 

**⁸** I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law *is* within my heart. 

**⁹** I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest. 

**¹⁰** I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation. 

**¹¹** Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me. 

**¹²** For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me. 

**¹³** Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me. 

**¹⁴** Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil. 

**¹⁵** Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha. 

**¹⁶** Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified. 

**¹⁷** But I *am* poor and needy; *yet* the Lord thinketh upon me: thou *art* my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.
