# Psalm 58

<sup>1</sup> Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men? 

<sup>2</sup> Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth. 

<sup>3</sup> The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies. 

<sup>4</sup> Their poison *is* like the poison of a serpent: *they are* like the deaf adder *that* stoppeth her ear; 

<sup>5</sup> Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely. 

<sup>6</sup> Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD. 

<sup>7</sup> Let them melt away as waters *which* run continually: *when* he bendeth *his bow to shoot* his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces. 

<sup>8</sup> As a snail *which* melteth, let *every one of them* pass away: *like* the untimely birth of a woman, *that* they may not see the sun. 

<sup>9</sup> Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in *his* wrath. 

<sup>10</sup> The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. 

<sup>11</sup> So that a man shall say, Verily *there is* a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.
