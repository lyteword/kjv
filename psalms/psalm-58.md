# Psalm 58

**¹** Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men? 

**²** Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth. 

**³** The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies. 

**⁴** Their poison *is* like the poison of a serpent: *they are* like the deaf adder *that* stoppeth her ear; 

**⁵** Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely. 

**⁶** Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD. 

**⁷** Let them melt away as waters *which* run continually: *when* he bendeth *his bow to shoot* his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces. 

**⁸** As a snail *which* melteth, let *every one of them* pass away: *like* the untimely birth of a woman, *that* they may not see the sun. 

**⁹** Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in *his* wrath. 

**¹⁰** The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. 

**¹¹** So that a man shall say, Verily *there is* a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.
