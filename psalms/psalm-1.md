# Psalm 1 

**¹** Blessed *is* the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. 

**²** But his delight *is* in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. 

**³** And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. 

**⁴** The ungodly *are* not so: but *are* like the chaff which the wind driveth away. 

**⁵** Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 

**⁶** For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
