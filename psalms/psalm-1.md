# Psalm 1

<sup>1</sup> Blessed *is* the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. 

<sup>2</sup> But his delight *is* in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. 

<sup>3</sup> And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. 

<sup>4</sup> The ungodly *are* not so: but *are* like the chaff which the wind driveth away. 

<sup>5</sup> Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 

<sup>6</sup> For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
