# Psalm 126 

**¹** When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. 

**²** Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them. 

**³** The LORD hath done great things for us; *whereof* we are glad. 

**⁴** Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south. 

**⁵** They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. 

**⁶** He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves *with him*.
