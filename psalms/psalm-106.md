# Psalm 106 

**¹** Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for *he is* good: for his mercy *endureth* for ever. 

**²** Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? *who* can shew forth all his praise? 

**³** Blessed *are* they that keep judgment, *and* he that doeth righteousness at all times. 

**⁴** Remember me, O LORD, with the favour *that thou bearest unto* thy people: O visit me with thy salvation; 

**⁵** That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance. 

**⁶** We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. 

**⁷** Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked *him* at the sea, *even* at the Red sea. 

**⁸** Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. 

**⁹** He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness. 

**¹⁰** And he saved them from the hand of him that hated *them*, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. 

**¹¹** And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left. 

**¹²** Then believed they his words; they sang his praise. 

**¹³** They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel: 

**¹⁴** But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. 

**¹⁵** And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. 

**¹⁶** They envied Moses also in the camp, *and* Aaron the saint of the LORD. 

**¹⁷** The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. 

**¹⁸** And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. 

**¹⁹** They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image. 

**²⁰** Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. 

**²¹** They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt; 

**²²** Wondrous works in the land of Ham, *and* terrible things by the Red sea. 

**²³** Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy *them*. 

**²⁴** Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word: 

**²⁵** But murmured in their tents, *and* hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD. 

**²⁶** Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness: 

**²⁷** To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. 

**²⁸** They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. 

**²⁹** Thus they provoked *him* to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them. 

**³⁰** Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and *so* the plague was stayed. 

**³¹** And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore. 

**³²** They angered *him* also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: 

**³³** Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips. 

**³⁴** They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them: 

**³⁵** But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. 

**³⁶** And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them. 

**³⁷** Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils, 

**³⁸** And shed innocent blood, *even* the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood. 

**³⁹** Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions. 

**⁴⁰** Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. 

**⁴¹** And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them. 

**⁴²** Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. 

**⁴³** Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked *him* with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity. 

**⁴⁴** Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry: 

**⁴⁵** And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies. 

**⁴⁶** He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives. 

**⁴⁷** Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, *and* to triumph in thy praise. 

**⁴⁸** Blessed *be* the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.
