# Psalm 62 

**¹** Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him *cometh* my salvation. 

**²** He only *is* my rock and my salvation; *he is* my defence; I shall not be greatly moved. 

**³** How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall *shall ye be, and as* a tottering fence. 

**⁴** They only consult to cast *him* down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah. 

**⁵** My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation *is* from him. 

**⁶** He only *is* my rock and my salvation: *he is* my defence; I shall not be moved. 

**⁷** In God *is* my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, *and* my refuge, *is* in God. 

**⁸** Trust in him at all times; *ye* people, pour out your heart before him: God *is* a refuge for us. Selah. 

**⁹** Surely men of low degree *are* vanity, *and* men of high degree *are* a lie: to be laid in the balance, they *are* altogether *lighter* than vanity. 

**¹⁰** Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart *upon them*. 

**¹¹** God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power *belongeth* unto God. 

**¹²** Also unto thee, O Lord, *belongeth* mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.
