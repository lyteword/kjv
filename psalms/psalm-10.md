# Psalm 10 

**¹** Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? *why* hidest thou *thyself* in times of trouble? 

**²** The wicked in *his* pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined. 

**³** For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, and blesseth the covetous, *whom* the LORD abhorreth. 

**⁴** The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek *after God:* God *is* not in all his thoughts. 

**⁵** His ways are always grievous; thy judgments *are* far above out of his sight: *as for* all his enemies, he puffeth at them. 

**⁶** He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for *I shall* never *be* in adversity. 

**⁷** His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue *is* mischief and vanity. 

**⁸** He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor. 

**⁹** He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net. 

**¹⁰** He croucheth, *and* humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones. 

**¹¹** He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see *it*. 

**¹²** Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble. 

**¹³** Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require *it*. 

**¹⁴** Thou hast seen *it;* for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite *it* with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless. 

**¹⁵** Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil *man:* seek out his wickedness *till* thou find none. 

**¹⁶** The LORD *is* King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land. 

**¹⁷** LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear: 

**¹⁸** To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.
