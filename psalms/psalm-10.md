# Psalm 10

<sup>1</sup> Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble? 

<sup>2</sup> The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined. 

<sup>3</sup> For the wicked boasteth of his heartâ€™s desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth. 

<sup>4</sup> The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts. 

<sup>5</sup> His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them. 

<sup>6</sup> He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity. 

<sup>7</sup> His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity. 

<sup>8</sup> He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor. 

<sup>9</sup> He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net. 

<sup>10</sup> He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones. 

<sup>11</sup> He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it. 

<sup>12</sup> Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble. 

<sup>13</sup> Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it. 

<sup>14</sup> Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless. 

<sup>15</sup> Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none. 

<sup>16</sup> The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land. 

<sup>17</sup> LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear: 

<sup>18</sup> To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.
