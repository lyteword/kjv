# Psalm 116

**¹** I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice *and* my supplications. 

**²** Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon *him* as long as I live. 

**³** The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. 

**⁴** Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. 

**⁵** Gracious *is* the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God *is* merciful. 

**⁶** The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me. 

**⁷** Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee. 

**⁸** For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, *and* my feet from falling. 

**⁹** I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living. 

**¹⁰** I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted: 

**¹¹** I said in my haste, All men *are* liars. 

**¹²** What shall I render unto the LORD *for* all his benefits toward me? 

**¹³** I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD. 

**¹⁴** I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people. 

**¹⁵** Precious in the sight of the LORD *is* the death of his saints. 

**¹⁶** O LORD, truly I *am* thy servant; I *am* thy servant, *and* the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds. 

**¹⁷** I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD. 

**¹⁸** I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people, 

**¹⁹** In the courts of the LORD’s house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
