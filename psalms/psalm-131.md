# Psalm 131 

**¹** LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. 

**²** Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul *is* even as a weaned child. 

**³** Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.
