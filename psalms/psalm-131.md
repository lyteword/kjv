# Psalm 131

<sup>1</sup> A Song of degrees of David. LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. 

<sup>2</sup> Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child. 

<sup>3</sup> Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.
