# Psalm 80 

**¹** Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest *between* the cherubims, shine forth. 

**²** Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come *and* save us. 

**³** Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. 

**⁴** O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? 

**⁵** Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure. 

**⁶** Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves. 

**⁷** Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. 

**⁸** Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. 

**⁹** Thou preparedst *room* before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land. 

**¹⁰** The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof *were like* the goodly cedars. 

**¹¹** She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river. 

**¹²** Why hast thou *then* broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her? 

**¹³** The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it. 

**¹⁴** Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine; 

**¹⁵** And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch *that* thou madest strong for thyself. 

**¹⁶** *It is* burned with fire, *it is* cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. 

**¹⁷** Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man *whom* thou madest strong for thyself. 

**¹⁸** So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name. 

**¹⁹** Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
