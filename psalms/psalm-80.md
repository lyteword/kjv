# Psalm 80

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim-eduth, A Psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth. 

<sup>2</sup> Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us. 

<sup>3</sup> Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. 

<sup>4</sup> O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? 

<sup>5</sup> Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure. 

<sup>6</sup> Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves. 

<sup>7</sup> Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. 

<sup>8</sup> Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. 

<sup>9</sup> Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land. 

<sup>10</sup> The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars. 

<sup>11</sup> She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river. 

<sup>12</sup> Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her? 

<sup>13</sup> The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it. 

<sup>14</sup> Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine; 

<sup>15</sup> And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself. 

<sup>16</sup> It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. 

<sup>17</sup> Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself. 

<sup>18</sup> So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name. 

<sup>19</sup> Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
