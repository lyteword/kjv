# Psalm 51

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. 

<sup>2</sup> Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 

<sup>3</sup> For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. 

<sup>4</sup> Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. 

<sup>5</sup> Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me. 

<sup>6</sup> Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom. 

<sup>7</sup> Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 

<sup>8</sup> Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. 

<sup>9</sup> Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. 

<sup>10</sup> Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. 

<sup>11</sup> Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me. 

<sup>12</sup> Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit. 

<sup>13</sup> Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee. 

<sup>14</sup> Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. 

<sup>15</sup> O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise. 

<sup>16</sup> For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering. 

<sup>17</sup> The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. 

<sup>18</sup> Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem. 

<sup>19</sup> Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
