# Psalm 38

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 

<sup>2</sup> For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore. 

<sup>3</sup> There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin. 

<sup>4</sup> For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me. 

<sup>5</sup> My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness. 

<sup>6</sup> I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long. 

<sup>7</sup> For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh. 

<sup>8</sup> I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart. 

<sup>9</sup> Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee. 

<sup>10</sup> My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. 

<sup>11</sup> My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off. 

<sup>12</sup> They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long. 

<sup>13</sup> But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. 

<sup>14</sup> Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs. 

<sup>15</sup> For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God. 

<sup>16</sup> For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me. 

<sup>17</sup> For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me. 

<sup>18</sup> For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin. 

<sup>19</sup> But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. 

<sup>20</sup> They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is. 

<sup>21</sup> Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me. 

<sup>22</sup> Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
