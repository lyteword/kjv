# Psalm 25

<sup>1</sup> Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul. 

<sup>2</sup> O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me. 

<sup>3</sup> Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause. 

<sup>4</sup> Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths. 

<sup>5</sup> Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou *art* the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day. 

<sup>6</sup> Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they *have been* ever of old. 

<sup>7</sup> Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness’ sake, O LORD. 

<sup>8</sup> Good and upright *is* the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way. 

<sup>9</sup> The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way. 

<sup>10</sup> All the paths of the LORD *are* mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. 

<sup>11</sup> For thy name’s sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it *is* great. 

<sup>12</sup> What man *is* he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way *that* he shall choose. 

<sup>13</sup> His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth. 

<sup>14</sup> The secret of the LORD *is* with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant. 

<sup>15</sup> Mine eyes *are* ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net. 

<sup>16</sup> Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I *am* desolate and afflicted. 

<sup>17</sup> The troubles of my heart are enlarged: *O* bring thou me out of my distresses. 

<sup>18</sup> Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins. 

<sup>19</sup> Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred. 

<sup>20</sup> O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee. 

<sup>21</sup> Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee. 

<sup>22</sup> Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
