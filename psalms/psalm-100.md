# Psalm 100

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of praise. Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands. 

<sup>2</sup> Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing. 

<sup>3</sup> Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 

<sup>4</sup> Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name. 

<sup>5</sup> For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.
