# Psalm 100

**¹** Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands. 

**²** Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing. 

**³** Know ye that the LORD he *is* God: *it is* he *that* hath made us, and not we ourselves; *we are* his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 

**⁴** Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, *and* into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, *and* bless his name. 

**⁵** For the LORD *is* good; his mercy *is* everlasting; and his truth *endureth* to all generations.
