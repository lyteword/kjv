# Psalm 110

**¹** The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. 

**²** The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. 

**³** Thy people *shall be* willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth. 

**⁴** The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou *art* a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. 

**⁵** The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. 

**⁶** He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill *the places* with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries. 

**⁷** He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.
