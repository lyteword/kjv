# Psalm 107

**¹** O give thanks unto the LORD, for *he is* good: for his mercy *endureth* for ever. 

**²** Let the redeemed of the LORD say *so*, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy; 

**³** And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south. 

**⁴** They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in. 

**⁵** Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. 

**⁶** Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, *and* he delivered them out of their distresses. 

**⁷** And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. 

**⁸** Oh that *men* would praise the LORD *for* his goodness, and *for* his wonderful works to the children of men! 

**⁹** For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. 

**¹⁰** Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, *being* bound in affliction and iron; 

**¹¹** Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High: 

**¹²** Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and *there was* none to help. 

**¹³** Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, *and* he saved them out of their distresses. 

**¹⁴** He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder. 

**¹⁵** Oh that *men* would praise the LORD *for* his goodness, and *for* his wonderful works to the children of men! 

**¹⁶** For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. 

**¹⁷** Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. 

**¹⁸** Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death. 

**¹⁹** Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, *and* he saveth them out of their distresses. 

**²⁰** He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered *them* from their destructions. 

**²¹** Oh that *men* would praise the LORD *for* his goodness, and *for* his wonderful works to the children of men! 

**²²** And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing. 

**²³** They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; 

**²⁴** These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep. 

**²⁵** For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. 

**²⁶** They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. 

**²⁷** They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits’ end. 

**²⁸** Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. 

**²⁹** He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. 

**³⁰** Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven. 

**³¹** Oh that *men* would praise the LORD *for* his goodness, and *for* his wonderful works to the children of men! 

**³²** Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders. 

**³³** He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground; 

**³⁴** A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. 

**³⁵** He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings. 

**³⁶** And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation; 

**³⁷** And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase. 

**³⁸** He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease. 

**³⁹** Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow. 

**⁴⁰** He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, *where there is* no way. 

**⁴¹** Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh *him* families like a flock. 

**⁴²** The righteous shall see *it*, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth. 

**⁴³** Whoso *is* wise, and will observe these *things*, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.
