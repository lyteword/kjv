# Psalm 78

<sup>1</sup> Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. 

<sup>2</sup> I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old: 

<sup>3</sup> Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. 

<sup>4</sup> We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. 

<sup>5</sup> For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: 

<sup>6</sup> That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children: 

<sup>7</sup> That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: 

<sup>8</sup> And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God. 

<sup>9</sup> The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. 

<sup>10</sup> They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; 

<sup>11</sup> And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them. 

<sup>12</sup> Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. 

<sup>13</sup> He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap. 

<sup>14</sup> In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. 

<sup>15</sup> He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths. 

<sup>16</sup> He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. 

<sup>17</sup> And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness. 

<sup>18</sup> And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust. 

<sup>19</sup> Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? 

<sup>20</sup> Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? 

<sup>21</sup> Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel; 

<sup>22</sup> Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation: 

<sup>23</sup> Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, 

<sup>24</sup> And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven. 

<sup>25</sup> Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full. 

<sup>26</sup> He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. 

<sup>27</sup> He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea: 

<sup>28</sup> And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations. 

<sup>29</sup> So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire; 

<sup>30</sup> They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths, 

<sup>31</sup> The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel. 

<sup>32</sup> For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works. 

<sup>33</sup> Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. 

<sup>34</sup> When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. 

<sup>35</sup> And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer. 

<sup>36</sup> Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues. 

<sup>37</sup> For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant. 

<sup>38</sup> But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. 

<sup>39</sup> For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. 

<sup>40</sup> How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! 

<sup>41</sup> Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel. 

<sup>42</sup> They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy. 

<sup>43</sup> How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan: 

<sup>44</sup> And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink. 

<sup>45</sup> He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. 

<sup>46</sup> He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. 

<sup>47</sup> He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost. 

<sup>48</sup> He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. 

<sup>49</sup> He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. 

<sup>50</sup> He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; 

<sup>51</sup> And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham: 

<sup>52</sup> But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. 

<sup>53</sup> And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. 

<sup>54</sup> And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased. 

<sup>55</sup> He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. 

<sup>56</sup> Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: 

<sup>57</sup> But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. 

<sup>58</sup> For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. 

<sup>59</sup> When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: 

<sup>60</sup> So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men; 

<sup>61</sup> And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand. 

<sup>62</sup> He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. 

<sup>63</sup> The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. 

<sup>64</sup> Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. 

<sup>65</sup> Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. 

<sup>66</sup> And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach. 

<sup>67</sup> Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: 

<sup>68</sup> But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. 

<sup>69</sup> And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever. 

<sup>70</sup> He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: 

<sup>71</sup> From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. 

<sup>72</sup> So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
