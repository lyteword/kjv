# Psalm 78 

**¹** Give ear, O my people, *to* my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. 

**²** I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old: 

**³** Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. 

**⁴** We will not hide *them* from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. 

**⁵** For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: 

**⁶** That the generation to come might know *them, even* the children *which* should be born; *who* should arise and declare *them* to their children: 

**⁷** That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: 

**⁸** And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation *that* set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God. 

**⁹** The children of Ephraim, *being* armed, *and* carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. 

**¹⁰** They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; 

**¹¹** And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them. 

**¹²** Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, *in* the field of Zoan. 

**¹³** He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap. 

**¹⁴** In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. 

**¹⁵** He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave *them* drink as *out of* the great depths. 

**¹⁶** He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. 

**¹⁷** And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness. 

**¹⁸** And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust. 

**¹⁹** Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? 

**²⁰** Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? 

**²¹** Therefore the LORD heard *this*, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel; 

**²²** Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation: 

**²³** Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, 

**²⁴** And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven. 

**²⁵** Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full. 

**²⁶** He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. 

**²⁷** He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea: 

**²⁸** And he let *it* fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations. 

**²⁹** So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire; 

**³⁰** They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat *was* yet in their mouths, 

**³¹** The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen *men* of Israel. 

**³²** For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works. 

**³³** Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. 

**³⁴** When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. 

**³⁵** And they remembered that God *was* their rock, and the high God their redeemer. 

**³⁶** Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues. 

**³⁷** For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant. 

**³⁸** But he, *being* full of compassion, forgave *their* iniquity, and destroyed *them* not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. 

**³⁹** For he remembered that they *were but* flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. 

**⁴⁰** How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, *and* grieve him in the desert! 

**⁴¹** Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel. 

**⁴²** They remembered not his hand, *nor* the day when he delivered them from the enemy. 

**⁴³** How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan: 

**⁴⁴** And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink. 

**⁴⁵** He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. 

**⁴⁶** He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. 

**⁴⁷** He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost. 

**⁴⁸** He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. 

**⁴⁹** He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels *among them*. 

**⁵⁰** He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; 

**⁵¹** And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of *their* strength in the tabernacles of Ham: 

**⁵²** But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. 

**⁵³** And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. 

**⁵⁴** And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, *even to* this mountain, *which* his right hand had purchased. 

**⁵⁵** He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. 

**⁵⁶** Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: 

**⁵⁷** But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. 

**⁵⁸** For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. 

**⁵⁹** When God heard *this*, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: 

**⁶⁰** So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent *which* he placed among men; 

**⁶¹** And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand. 

**⁶²** He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. 

**⁶³** The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. 

**⁶⁴** Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. 

**⁶⁵** Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, *and* like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. 

**⁶⁶** And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach. 

**⁶⁷** Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: 

**⁶⁸** But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. 

**⁶⁹** And he built his sanctuary like high *palaces*, like the earth which he hath established for ever. 

**⁷⁰** He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: 

**⁷¹** From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. 

**⁷²** So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
