# Psalm 45

**¹** My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue *is* the pen of a ready writer. 

**²** Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. 

**³** Gird thy sword upon *thy* thigh, O *most* mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. 

**⁴** And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness *and* righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. 

**⁵** Thine arrows *are* sharp in the heart of the king’s enemies; *whereby* the people fall under thee. 

**⁶** Thy throne, O God, *is* for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom *is* a right sceptre. 

**⁷** Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. 

**⁸** All thy garments *smell* of myrrh, and aloes, *and* cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad. 

**⁹** Kings’ daughters *were* among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir. 

**¹⁰** Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house; 

**¹¹** So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he *is* thy Lord; and worship thou him. 

**¹²** And the daughter of Tyre *shall be there* with a gift; *even* the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour. 

**¹³** The king’s daughter *is* all glorious within: her clothing *is* of wrought gold. 

**¹⁴** She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee. 

**¹⁵** With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king’s palace. 

**¹⁶** Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth. 

**¹⁷** I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.
