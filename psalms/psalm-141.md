# Psalm 141 

**¹** LORD, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee. 

**²** Let my prayer be set forth before thee *as* incense; *and* the lifting up of my hands *as* the evening sacrifice. 

**³** Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips. 

**⁴** Incline not my heart to *any* evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties. 

**⁵** Let the righteous smite me; *it shall be* a kindness: and let him reprove me; *it shall be* an excellent oil, *which* shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also *shall be* in their calamities. 

**⁶** When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet. 

**⁷** Our bones are scattered at the grave’s mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth *wood* upon the earth. 

**⁸** But mine eyes *are* unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute. 

**⁹** Keep me from the snares *which* they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity. 

**¹⁰** Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.
