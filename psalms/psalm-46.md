# Psalm 46

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, A Song upon Alamoth. God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. 

<sup>2</sup> Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; 

<sup>3</sup> Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah. 

<sup>4</sup> There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High. 

<sup>5</sup> God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early. 

<sup>6</sup> The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted. 

<sup>7</sup> The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah. 

<sup>8</sup> Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth. 

<sup>9</sup> He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire. 

<sup>10</sup> Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. 

<sup>11</sup> The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
