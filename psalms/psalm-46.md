# Psalm 46 

**¹** God *is* our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. 

**²** Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; 

**³** *Though* the waters thereof roar *and* be troubled, *though* the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah. 

**⁴** *There is* a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy *place* of the tabernacles of the most High. 

**⁵** God *is* in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, *and that* right early. 

**⁶** The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted. 

**⁷** The LORD of hosts *is* with us; the God of Jacob *is* our refuge. Selah. 

**⁸** Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth. 

**⁹** He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire. 

**¹⁰** Be still, and know that I *am* God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. 

**¹¹** The LORD of hosts *is* with us; the God of Jacob *is* our refuge. Selah.
