# Psalm 112

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments. 

<sup>2</sup> His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed. 

<sup>3</sup> Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever. 

<sup>4</sup> Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous. 

<sup>5</sup> A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion. 

<sup>6</sup> Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance. 

<sup>7</sup> He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD. 

<sup>8</sup> His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies. 

<sup>9</sup> He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour. 

<sup>10</sup> The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.
