# Psalm 81

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of Asaph. Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. 

<sup>2</sup> Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery. 

<sup>3</sup> Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day. 

<sup>4</sup> For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob. 

<sup>5</sup> This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not. 

<sup>6</sup> I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots. 

<sup>7</sup> Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah. 

<sup>8</sup> Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me; 

<sup>9</sup> There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god. 

<sup>10</sup> I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. 

<sup>11</sup> But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me. 

<sup>12</sup> So I gave them up unto their own heartsâ€™ lust: and they walked in their own counsels. 

<sup>13</sup> Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways! 

<sup>14</sup> I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries. 

<sup>15</sup> The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever. 

<sup>16</sup> He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.
