# Psalm 81 

**¹** Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. 

**²** Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery. 

**³** Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day. 

**⁴** For this *was* a statute for Israel, *and* a law of the God of Jacob. 

**⁵** This he ordained in Joseph *for* a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: *where* I heard a language *that* I understood not. 

**⁶** I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots. 

**⁷** Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah. 

**⁸** Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me; 

**⁹** There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god. 

**¹⁰** I *am* the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. 

**¹¹** But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me. 

**¹²** So I gave them up unto their own hearts’ lust: *and* they walked in their own counsels. 

**¹³** Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, *and* Israel had walked in my ways! 

**¹⁴** I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries. 

**¹⁵** The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever. 

**¹⁶** He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.
