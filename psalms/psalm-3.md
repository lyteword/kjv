# Psalm 3

<sup>1</sup> LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many *are* they that rise up against me. 

<sup>2</sup> Many *there be* which say of my soul, *There is* no help for him in God. Selah. 

<sup>3</sup> But thou, O LORD, *art* a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head. 

<sup>4</sup> I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah. 

<sup>5</sup> I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me. 

<sup>6</sup> I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set *themselves* against me round about. 

<sup>7</sup> Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies *upon* the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly. 

<sup>8</sup> Salvation *belongeth* unto the LORD: thy blessing *is* upon thy people. Selah.
