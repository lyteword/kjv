# Psalm 3 

**¹** LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many *are* they that rise up against me. 

**²** Many *there be* which say of my soul, *There is* no help for him in God. Selah. 

**³** But thou, O LORD, *art* a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head. 

**⁴** I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah. 

**⁵** I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me. 

**⁶** I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set *themselves* against me round about. 

**⁷** Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies *upon* the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly. 

**⁸** Salvation *belongeth* unto the LORD: thy blessing *is* upon thy people. Selah.
