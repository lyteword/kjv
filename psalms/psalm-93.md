# Psalm 93

<sup>1</sup> The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved. 

<sup>2</sup> Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting. 

<sup>3</sup> The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. 

<sup>4</sup> The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea. 

<sup>5</sup> Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.
