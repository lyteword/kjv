# Psalm 93 

**¹** The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, *wherewith* he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved. 

**²** Thy throne *is* established of old: thou *art* from everlasting. 

**³** The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. 

**⁴** The LORD on high *is* mightier than the noise of many waters, *yea, than* the mighty waves of the sea. 

**⁵** Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.
