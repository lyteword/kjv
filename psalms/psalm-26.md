# Psalm 26

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide. 

<sup>2</sup> Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart. 

<sup>3</sup> For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth. 

<sup>4</sup> I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers. 

<sup>5</sup> I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked. 

<sup>6</sup> I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD: 

<sup>7</sup> That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works. 

<sup>8</sup> LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth. 

<sup>9</sup> Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men: 

<sup>10</sup> In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes. 

<sup>11</sup> But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me. 

<sup>12</sup> My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.
