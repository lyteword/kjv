# Psalm 26 

**¹** Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; *therefore* I shall not slide. 

**²** Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart. 

**³** For thy lovingkindness *is* before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth. 

**⁴** I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers. 

**⁵** I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked. 

**⁶** I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD: 

**⁷** That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works. 

**⁸** LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth. 

**⁹** Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men: 

**¹⁰** In whose hands *is* mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes. 

**¹¹** But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me. 

**¹²** My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.
