# Psalm 54

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, A Psalm of David, when the Ziphims came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us? Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength. 

<sup>2</sup> Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth. 

<sup>3</sup> For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah. 

<sup>4</sup> Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul. 

<sup>5</sup> He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth. 

<sup>6</sup> I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for it is good. 

<sup>7</sup> For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.
