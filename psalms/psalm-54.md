# Psalm 54

**¹** Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength. 

**²** Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth. 

**³** For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah. 

**⁴** Behold, God *is* mine helper: the Lord *is* with them that uphold my soul. 

**⁵** He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth. 

**⁶** I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for *it is* good. 

**⁷** For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen *his desire* upon mine enemies.
