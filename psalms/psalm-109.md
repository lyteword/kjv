# Psalm 109

<sup>1</sup> To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise; 

<sup>2</sup> For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue. 

<sup>3</sup> They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause. 

<sup>4</sup> For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer. 

<sup>5</sup> And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love. 

<sup>6</sup> Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand. 

<sup>7</sup> When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin. 

<sup>8</sup> Let his days be few; and let another take his office. 

<sup>9</sup> Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. 

<sup>10</sup> Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places. 

<sup>11</sup> Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour. 

<sup>12</sup> Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children. 

<sup>13</sup> Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out. 

<sup>14</sup> Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. 

<sup>15</sup> Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth. 

<sup>16</sup> Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart. 

<sup>17</sup> As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him. 

<sup>18</sup> As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones. 

<sup>19</sup> Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually. 

<sup>20</sup> Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul. 

<sup>21</sup> But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy nameâ€™s sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me. 

<sup>22</sup> For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me. 

<sup>23</sup> I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust. 

<sup>24</sup> My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness. 

<sup>25</sup> I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads. 

<sup>26</sup> Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy: 

<sup>27</sup> That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it. 

<sup>28</sup> Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice. 

<sup>29</sup> Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle. 

<sup>30</sup> I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude. 

<sup>31</sup> For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.
