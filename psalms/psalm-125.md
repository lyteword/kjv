# Psalm 125 

**¹** They that trust in the LORD *shall be* as mount Zion, *which* cannot be removed, *but* abideth for ever. 

**²** As the mountains *are* round about Jerusalem, so the LORD *is* round about his people from henceforth even for ever. 

**³** For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity. 

**⁴** Do good, O LORD, unto *those that be* good, and *to them that are* upright in their hearts. 

**⁵** As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: *but* peace *shall be* upon Israel.
