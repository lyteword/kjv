# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish’s belly, 

<sup>2</sup> And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, *and* thou heardest my voice. 

<sup>3</sup> For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me. 

<sup>4</sup> Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple. 

<sup>5</sup> The waters compassed me about, *even* to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head. 

<sup>6</sup> I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars *was* about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God. 

<sup>7</sup> When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple. 

<sup>8</sup> They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. 

<sup>9</sup> But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay *that* that I have vowed. Salvation *is* of the LORD. 

<sup>10</sup> ¶ And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry *land*.
