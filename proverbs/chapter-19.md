# Chapter 19

**¹** Better *is* the poor that walketh in his integrity, than *he that is* perverse in his lips, and is a fool. 

**²** Also, *that* the soul *be* without knowledge, *it is* not good; and he that hasteth with *his* feet sinneth. 

**³** The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD. 

**⁴** Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour. 

**⁵** A false witness shall not be unpunished, and *he that* speaketh lies shall not escape. 

**⁶** Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man *is* a friend to him that giveth gifts. 

**⁷** All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth *them with* words, *yet* they *are* wanting *to him*. 

**⁸** He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good. 

**⁹** A false witness shall not be unpunished, and *he that* speaketh lies shall perish. 

**¹⁰** Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes. 

**¹¹** The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and *it is* his glory to pass over a transgression. 

**¹²** The king’s wrath *is* as the roaring of a lion; but his favour *is* as dew upon the grass. 

**¹³** A foolish son *is* the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife *are* a continual dropping. 

**¹⁴** House and riches *are* the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife *is* from the LORD. 

**¹⁵** Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger. 

**¹⁶** He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; *but* he that despiseth his ways shall die. 

**¹⁷** He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again. 

**¹⁸** Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying. 

**¹⁹** A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver *him*, yet thou must do it again. 

**²⁰** Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. 

**²¹** *There are* many devices in a man’s heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand. 

**²²** The desire of a man *is* his kindness: and a poor man *is* better than a liar. 

**²³** The fear of the LORD *tendeth* to life: and *he that hath it* shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil. 

**²⁴** A slothful *man* hideth his hand in *his* bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. 

**²⁵** Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, *and* he will understand knowledge. 

**²⁶** He that wasteth *his* father, *and* chaseth away *his* mother, *is* a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach. 

**²⁷** Cease, my son, to hear the instruction *that causeth* to err from the words of knowledge. 

**²⁸** An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity. 

**²⁹** Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.
