# Chapter 19

<sup>1</sup> Better *is* the poor that walketh in his integrity, than *he that is* perverse in his lips, and is a fool. 

<sup>2</sup> Also, *that* the soul *be* without knowledge, *it is* not good; and he that hasteth with *his* feet sinneth. 

<sup>3</sup> The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD. 

<sup>4</sup> Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour. 

<sup>5</sup> A false witness shall not be unpunished, and *he that* speaketh lies shall not escape. 

<sup>6</sup> Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man *is* a friend to him that giveth gifts. 

<sup>7</sup> All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth *them with* words, *yet* they *are* wanting *to him*. 

<sup>8</sup> He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good. 

<sup>9</sup> A false witness shall not be unpunished, and *he that* speaketh lies shall perish. 

<sup>10</sup> Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes. 

<sup>11</sup> The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and *it is* his glory to pass over a transgression. 

<sup>12</sup> The king’s wrath *is* as the roaring of a lion; but his favour *is* as dew upon the grass. 

<sup>13</sup> A foolish son *is* the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife *are* a continual dropping. 

<sup>14</sup> House and riches *are* the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife *is* from the LORD. 

<sup>15</sup> Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger. 

<sup>16</sup> He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; *but* he that despiseth his ways shall die. 

<sup>17</sup> He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again. 

<sup>18</sup> Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying. 

<sup>19</sup> A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver *him*, yet thou must do it again. 

<sup>20</sup> Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. 

<sup>21</sup> *There are* many devices in a man’s heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand. 

<sup>22</sup> The desire of a man *is* his kindness: and a poor man *is* better than a liar. 

<sup>23</sup> The fear of the LORD *tendeth* to life: and *he that hath it* shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil. 

<sup>24</sup> A slothful *man* hideth his hand in *his* bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. 

<sup>25</sup> Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, *and* he will understand knowledge. 

<sup>26</sup> He that wasteth *his* father, *and* chaseth away *his* mother, *is* a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach. 

<sup>27</sup> Cease, my son, to hear the instruction *that causeth* to err from the words of knowledge. 

<sup>28</sup> An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity. 

<sup>29</sup> Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.
