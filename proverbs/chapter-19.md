# Chapter 19

<sup>1</sup> Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool. 

<sup>2</sup> Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth. 

<sup>3</sup> The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD. 

<sup>4</sup> Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour. 

<sup>5</sup> A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape. 

<sup>6</sup> Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts. 

<sup>7</sup> All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him. 

<sup>8</sup> He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good. 

<sup>9</sup> A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish. 

<sup>10</sup> Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes. 

<sup>11</sup> The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression. 

<sup>12</sup> The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass. 

<sup>13</sup> A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping. 

<sup>14</sup> House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD. 

<sup>15</sup> Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger. 

<sup>16</sup> He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die. 

<sup>17</sup> He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again. 

<sup>18</sup> Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying. 

<sup>19</sup> A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again. 

<sup>20</sup> Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. 

<sup>21</sup> There are many devices in a man’s heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand. 

<sup>22</sup> The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar. 

<sup>23</sup> The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil. 

<sup>24</sup> A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. 

<sup>25</sup> Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge. 

<sup>26</sup> He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach. 

<sup>27</sup> Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge. 

<sup>28</sup> An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity. 

<sup>29</sup> Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.
