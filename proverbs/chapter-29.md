# Chapter 29

<sup>1</sup> He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. 

<sup>2</sup> When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn. 

<sup>3</sup> Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance. 

<sup>4</sup> The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it. 

<sup>5</sup> A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet. 

<sup>6</sup> In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice. 

<sup>7</sup> The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the wicked regardeth not to know it. 

<sup>8</sup> Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away wrath. 

<sup>9</sup> If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest. 

<sup>10</sup> The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul. 

<sup>11</sup> A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards. 

<sup>12</sup> If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked. 

<sup>13</sup> The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes. 

<sup>14</sup> The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever. 

<sup>15</sup> The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame. 

<sup>16</sup> When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall. 

<sup>17</sup> Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul. 

<sup>18</sup> Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he. 

<sup>19</sup> A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer. 

<sup>20</sup> Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him. 

<sup>21</sup> He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length. 

<sup>22</sup> An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression. 

<sup>23</sup> A man’s pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit. 

<sup>24</sup> Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not. 

<sup>25</sup> The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe. 

<sup>26</sup> Many seek the ruler’s favour; but every man’s judgment cometh from the LORD. 

<sup>27</sup> An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.
