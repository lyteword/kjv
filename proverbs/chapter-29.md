# Proverbs 29 

**¹** He, that being often reproved hardeneth *his* neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. 

**²** When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn. 

**³** Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth *his* substance. 

**⁴** The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it. 

**⁵** A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet. 

**⁶** In the transgression of an evil man *there is* a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice. 

**⁷** The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: *but* the wicked regardeth not to know *it*. 

**⁸** Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise *men* turn away wrath. 

**⁹** *If* a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, *there is* no rest. 

**¹⁰** The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul. 

**¹¹** A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise *man* keepeth it in till afterwards. 

**¹²** If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants *are* wicked. 

**¹³** The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes. 

**¹⁴** The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever. 

**¹⁵** The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left *to himself* bringeth his mother to shame. 

**¹⁶** When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall. 

**¹⁷** Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul. 

**¹⁸** Where *there is* no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy *is* he. 

**¹⁹** A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer. 

**²⁰** Seest thou a man *that is* hasty in his words? *there is* more hope of a fool than of him. 

**²¹** He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become *his* son at the length. 

**²²** An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression. 

**²³** A man’s pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit. 

**²⁴** Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth *it* not. 

**²⁵** The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe. 

**²⁶** Many seek the ruler’s favour; but *every* man’s judgment *cometh* from the LORD. 

**²⁷** An unjust man *is* an abomination to the just: and *he that is* upright in the way *is* abomination to the wicked.
