# Proverbs 18 

**¹** Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh *and* intermeddleth with all wisdom. 

**²** A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself. 

**³** When the wicked cometh, *then* cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach. 

**⁴** The words of a man’s mouth *are as* deep waters, *and* the wellspring of wisdom *as* a flowing brook. 

**⁵** *It is* not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment. 

**⁶** A fool’s lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes. 

**⁷** A fool’s mouth *is* his destruction, and his lips *are* the snare of his soul. 

**⁸** The words of a talebearer *are* as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. 

**⁹** He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster. 

**¹⁰** The name of the LORD *is* a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe. 

**¹¹** The rich man’s wealth *is* his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit. 

**¹²** Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour *is* humility. 

**¹³** He that answereth a matter before he heareth *it*, it *is* folly and shame unto him. 

**¹⁴** The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear? 

**¹⁵** The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge. 

**¹⁶** A man’s gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men. 

**¹⁷** *He that is* first in his own cause *seemeth* just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him. 

**¹⁸** The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty. 

**¹⁹** A brother offended *is harder to be won* than a strong city: and *their* contentions *are* like the bars of a castle. 

**²⁰** A man’s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; *and* with the increase of his lips shall he be filled. 

**²¹** Death and life *are* in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. 

**²²** *Whoso* findeth a wife findeth a good *thing*, and obtaineth favour of the LORD. 

**²³** The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly. 

**²⁴** A man *that hath* friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend *that* sticketh closer than a brother.
