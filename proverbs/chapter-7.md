# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee. 

<sup>2</sup> Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye. 

<sup>3</sup> Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart. 

<sup>4</sup> Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman: 

<sup>5</sup> That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words. 

<sup>6</sup> ¶ For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, 

<sup>7</sup> And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, 

<sup>8</sup> Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house, 

<sup>9</sup> In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night: 

<sup>10</sup> And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart. 

<sup>11</sup> (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: 

<sup>12</sup> Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.) 

<sup>13</sup> So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him, 

<sup>14</sup> I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows. 

<sup>15</sup> Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee. 

<sup>16</sup> I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt. 

<sup>17</sup> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 

<sup>18</sup> Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves. 

<sup>19</sup> For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey: 

<sup>20</sup> He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed. 

<sup>21</sup> With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him. 

<sup>22</sup> He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; 

<sup>23</sup> Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life. 

<sup>24</sup> ¶ Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth. 

<sup>25</sup> Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths. 

<sup>26</sup> For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her. 

<sup>27</sup> Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.
