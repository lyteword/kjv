# Proverbs 7 

**¹** My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee. 

**²** Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye. 

**³** Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart. 

**⁴** Say unto wisdom, Thou *art* my sister; and call understanding *thy* kinswoman: 

**⁵** That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger *which* flattereth with her words. 

**⁶** ¶ For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, 

**⁷** And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, 

**⁸** Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house, 

**⁹** In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night: 

**¹⁰** And, behold, there met him a woman *with* the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart. 

**¹¹** (She *is* loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: 

**¹²** Now *is she* without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.) 

**¹³** So she caught him, and kissed him, *and* with an impudent face said unto him, 

**¹⁴** *I have* peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows. 

**¹⁵** Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee. 

**¹⁶** I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved *works*, with fine linen of Egypt. 

**¹⁷** I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 

**¹⁸** Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves. 

**¹⁹** For the goodman *is* not at home, he is gone a long journey: 

**²⁰** He hath taken a bag of money with him, *and* will come home at the day appointed. 

**²¹** With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him. 

**²²** He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; 

**²³** Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it *is* for his life. 

**²⁴** ¶ Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth. 

**²⁵** Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths. 

**²⁶** For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong *men* have been slain by her. 

**²⁷** Her house *is* the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.
