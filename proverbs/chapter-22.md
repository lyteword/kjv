# Chapter 22

**¹** A *good* name *is* rather to be chosen than great riches, *and* loving favour rather than silver and gold. 

**²** The rich and poor meet together: the LORD *is* the maker of them all. 

**³** A prudent *man* foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished. 

**⁴** By humility *and* the fear of the LORD *are* riches, and honour, and life. 

**⁵** Thorns *and* snares *are* in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them. 

**⁶** Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it. 

**⁷** The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower *is* servant to the lender. 

**⁸** He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail. 

**⁹** He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor. 

**¹⁰** Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease. 

**¹¹** He that loveth pureness of heart, *for* the grace of his lips the king *shall be* his friend. 

**¹²** The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor. 

**¹³** The slothful *man* saith, *There is* a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets. 

**¹⁴** The mouth of strange women *is* a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein. 

**¹⁵** Foolishness *is* bound in the heart of a child; *but* the rod of correction shall drive it far from him. 

**¹⁶** He that oppresseth the poor to increase his *riches, and* he that giveth to the rich, *shall* surely *come* to want. 

**¹⁷** Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge. 

**¹⁸** For *it is* a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips. 

**¹⁹** That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee. 

**²⁰** Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge, 

**²¹** That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee? 

**²²** Rob not the poor, because he *is* poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate: 

**²³** For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them. 

**²⁴** Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go: 

**²⁵** Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul. 

**²⁶** Be not thou *one* of them that strike hands, *or* of them that are sureties for debts. 

**²⁷** If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee? 

**²⁸** Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set. 

**²⁹** Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean *men*.
