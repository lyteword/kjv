# Chapter 26

<sup>1</sup> As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool. 

<sup>2</sup> As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come. 

<sup>3</sup> A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the foolâ€™s back. 

<sup>4</sup> Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him. 

<sup>5</sup> Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit. 

<sup>6</sup> He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage. 

<sup>7</sup> The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools. 

<sup>8</sup> As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool. 

<sup>9</sup> As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools. 

<sup>10</sup> The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors. 

<sup>11</sup> As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly. 

<sup>12</sup> Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him. 

<sup>13</sup> The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets. 

<sup>14</sup> As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed. 

<sup>15</sup> The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth. 

<sup>16</sup> The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason. 

<sup>17</sup> He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears. 

<sup>18</sup> As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, 

<sup>19</sup> So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport? 

<sup>20</sup> Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth. 

<sup>21</sup> As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife. 

<sup>22</sup> The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. 

<sup>23</sup> Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross. 

<sup>24</sup> He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him; 

<sup>25</sup> When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart. 

<sup>26</sup> Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation. 

<sup>27</sup> Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him. 

<sup>28</sup> A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.
