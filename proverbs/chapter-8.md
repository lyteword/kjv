# Proverbs 8 

**¹** Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? 

**²** She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. 

**³** She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors. 

**⁴** Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice *is* to the sons of man. 

**⁵** O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart. 

**⁶** Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips *shall be* right things. 

**⁷** For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness *is* an abomination to my lips. 

**⁸** All the words of my mouth *are* in righteousness; *there is* nothing froward or perverse in them. 

**⁹** They *are* all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge. 

**¹⁰** Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. 

**¹¹** For wisdom *is* better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. 

**¹²** I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions. 

**¹³** The fear of the LORD *is* to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate. 

**¹⁴** Counsel *is* mine, and sound wisdom: I *am* understanding; I have strength. 

**¹⁵** By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. 

**¹⁶** By me princes rule, and nobles, *even* all the judges of the earth. 

**¹⁷** I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. 

**¹⁸** Riches and honour *are* with me; *yea*, durable riches and righteousness. 

**¹⁹** My fruit *is* better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. 

**²⁰** I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: 

**²¹** That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures. 

**²²** The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. 

**²³** I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. 

**²⁴** When *there were* no depths, I was brought forth; when *there were* no fountains abounding with water. 

**²⁵** Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth: 

**²⁶** While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. 

**²⁷** When he prepared the heavens, I *was* there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth: 

**²⁸** When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: 

**²⁹** When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth: 

**³⁰** Then I was by him, *as* one brought up *with him:* and I was daily *his* delight, rejoicing always before him; 

**³¹** Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights *were* with the sons of men. 

**³²** Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed *are they that* keep my ways. 

**³³** Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. 

**³⁴** Blessed *is* the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. 

**³⁵** For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD. 

**³⁶** But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.
