# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? 

<sup>2</sup> She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. 

<sup>3</sup> She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors. 

<sup>4</sup> Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man. 

<sup>5</sup> O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart. 

<sup>6</sup> Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things. 

<sup>7</sup> For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. 

<sup>8</sup> All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them. 

<sup>9</sup> They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge. 

<sup>10</sup> Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. 

<sup>11</sup> For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. 

<sup>12</sup> I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions. 

<sup>13</sup> The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate. 

<sup>14</sup> Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength. 

<sup>15</sup> By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. 

<sup>16</sup> By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth. 

<sup>17</sup> I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. 

<sup>18</sup> Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness. 

<sup>19</sup> My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. 

<sup>20</sup> I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: 

<sup>21</sup> That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures. 

<sup>22</sup> The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. 

<sup>23</sup> I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. 

<sup>24</sup> When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water. 

<sup>25</sup> Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth: 

<sup>26</sup> While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. 

<sup>27</sup> When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth: 

<sup>28</sup> When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: 

<sup>29</sup> When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth: 

<sup>30</sup> Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; 

<sup>31</sup> Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men. 

<sup>32</sup> Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways. 

<sup>33</sup> Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. 

<sup>34</sup> Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. 

<sup>35</sup> For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD. 

<sup>36</sup> But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.
