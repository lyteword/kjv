# Proverbs 24 

**¹** Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them. 

**²** For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief. 

**³** Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established: 

**⁴** And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches. 

**⁵** A wise man *is* strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength. 

**⁶** For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors *there is* safety. 

**⁷** Wisdom *is* too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate. 

**⁸** He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person. 

**⁹** The thought of foolishness *is* sin: and the scorner *is* an abomination to men. 

**¹⁰** *If* thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength *is* small. 

**¹¹** If thou forbear to deliver *them that are* drawn unto death, and *those that are* ready to be slain; 

**¹²** If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider *it*? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth *not* he know *it*? and shall *not* he render to *every* man according to his works? 

**¹³** My son, eat thou honey, because *it is* good; and the honeycomb, *which is* sweet to thy taste: 

**¹⁴** So *shall* the knowledge of wisdom *be* unto thy soul: when thou hast found *it*, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off. 

**¹⁵** Lay not wait, O wicked *man*, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place: 

**¹⁶** For a just *man* falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief. 

**¹⁷** Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth: 

**¹⁸** Lest the LORD see *it*, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him. 

**¹⁹** Fret not thyself because of evil *men*, neither be thou envious at the wicked; 

**²⁰** For there shall be no reward to the evil *man;* the candle of the wicked shall be put out. 

**²¹** My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: *and* meddle not with them that are given to change: 

**²²** For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both? 

**²³** These *things* also *belong* to the wise. *It is* not good to have respect of persons in judgment. 

**²⁴** He that saith unto the wicked, Thou *art* righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him: 

**²⁵** But to them that rebuke *him* shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them. 

**²⁶** *Every man* shall kiss *his* lips that giveth a right answer. 

**²⁷** Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house. 

**²⁸** Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive *not* with thy lips. 

**²⁹** Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work. 

**³⁰** I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; 

**³¹** And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, *and* nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down. 

**³²** Then I saw, *and* considered *it* well: I looked upon *it, and* received instruction. 

**³³** *Yet* a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: 

**³⁴** So shall thy poverty come *as* one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.
