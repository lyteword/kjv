# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, 

<sup>2</sup> Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. 

<sup>3</sup> Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend. 

<sup>4</sup> Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids. 

<sup>5</sup> Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. 

<sup>6</sup> ¶ Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: 

<sup>7</sup> Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, 

<sup>8</sup> Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest. 

<sup>9</sup> How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? 

<sup>10</sup> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: 

<sup>11</sup> So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man. 

<sup>12</sup> ¶ A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. 

<sup>13</sup> He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers; 

<sup>14</sup> Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord. 

<sup>15</sup> Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy. 

<sup>16</sup> ¶ These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him: 

<sup>17</sup> A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, 

<sup>18</sup> An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, 

<sup>19</sup> A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren. 

<sup>20</sup> ¶ My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother: 

<sup>21</sup> Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck. 

<sup>22</sup> When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. 

<sup>23</sup> For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: 

<sup>24</sup> To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. 

<sup>25</sup> Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. 

<sup>26</sup> For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. 

<sup>27</sup> Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? 

<sup>28</sup> Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? 

<sup>29</sup> So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent. 

<sup>30</sup> Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry; 

<sup>31</sup> But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house. 

<sup>32</sup> But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. 

<sup>33</sup> A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away. 

<sup>34</sup> For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. 

<sup>35</sup> He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
