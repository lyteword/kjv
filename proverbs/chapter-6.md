# Proverbs 6 

**¹** My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, *if* thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, 

**²** Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. 

**³** Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend. 

**⁴** Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids. 

**⁵** Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand *of the hunter*, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. 

**⁶** ¶ Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: 

**⁷** Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, 

**⁸** Provideth her meat in the summer, *and* gathereth her food in the harvest. 

**⁹** How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? 

**¹⁰** *Yet* a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: 

**¹¹** So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man. 

**¹²** ¶ A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. 

**¹³** He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers; 

**¹⁴** Frowardness *is* in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord. 

**¹⁵** Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy. 

**¹⁶** ¶ These six *things* doth the LORD hate: yea, seven *are* an abomination unto him: 

**¹⁷** A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, 

**¹⁸** An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, 

**¹⁹** A false witness *that* speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren. 

**²⁰** ¶ My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother: 

**²¹** Bind them continually upon thine heart, *and* tie them about thy neck. 

**²²** When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and *when* thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. 

**²³** For the commandment *is* a lamp; and the law *is* light; and reproofs of instruction *are* the way of life: 

**²⁴** To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. 

**²⁵** Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. 

**²⁶** For by means of a whorish woman *a man is brought* to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. 

**²⁷** Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? 

**²⁸** Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? 

**²⁹** So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent. 

**³⁰** *Men* do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry; 

**³¹** But *if* he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house. 

**³²** *But* whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he *that* doeth it destroyeth his own soul. 

**³³** A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away. 

**³⁴** For jealousy *is* the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. 

**³⁵** He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
