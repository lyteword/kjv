# Proverbs 20 

**¹** Wine *is* a mocker, strong drink *is* raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise. 

**²** The fear of a king *is* as the roaring of a lion: *whoso* provoketh him to anger sinneth *against* his own soul. 

**³** *It is* an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling. 

**⁴** The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; *therefore* shall he beg in harvest, and *have* nothing. 

**⁵** Counsel in the heart of man *is like* deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out. 

**⁶** Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find? 

**⁷** The just *man* walketh in his integrity: his children *are* blessed after him. 

**⁸** A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes. 

**⁹** Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? 

**¹⁰** Divers weights, *and* divers measures, both of them *are* alike abomination to the LORD. 

**¹¹** Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work *be* pure, and whether *it be* right. 

**¹²** The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them. 

**¹³** Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, *and* thou shalt be satisfied with bread. 

**¹⁴** *It is* naught, *it is* naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth. 

**¹⁵** There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge *are* a precious jewel. 

**¹⁶** Take his garment that is surety *for* a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. 

**¹⁷** Bread of deceit *is* sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. 

**¹⁸** *Every* purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war. 

**¹⁹** He that goeth about *as* a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips. 

**²⁰** Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness. 

**²¹** An inheritance *may be* gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed. 

**²²** Say not thou, I will recompense evil; *but* wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee. 

**²³** Divers weights *are* an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance *is* not good. 

**²⁴** Man’s goings *are* of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way? 

**²⁵** *It is* a snare to the man *who* devoureth *that which is* holy, and after vows to make enquiry. 

**²⁶** A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them. 

**²⁷** The spirit of man *is* the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly. 

**²⁸** Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy. 

**²⁹** The glory of young men *is* their strength: and the beauty of old men *is* the gray head. 

**³⁰** The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so *do* stripes the inward parts of the belly.
