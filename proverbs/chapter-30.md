# Chapter 30

<sup>1</sup> The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal, 

<sup>2</sup> Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man. 

<sup>3</sup> I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy. 

<sup>4</sup> Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son’s name, if thou canst tell? 

<sup>5</sup> Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. 

<sup>6</sup> Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar. 

<sup>7</sup> Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die: 

<sup>8</sup> Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: 

<sup>9</sup> Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain. 

<sup>10</sup> Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty. 

<sup>11</sup> There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother. 

<sup>12</sup> There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness. 

<sup>13</sup> There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up. 

<sup>14</sup> There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men. 

<sup>15</sup> The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough: 

<sup>16</sup> The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough. 

<sup>17</sup> The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it. 

<sup>18</sup> There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not: 

<sup>19</sup> The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid. 

<sup>20</sup> Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness. 

<sup>21</sup> For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear: 

<sup>22</sup> For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat; 

<sup>23</sup> For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress. 

<sup>24</sup> There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise: 

<sup>25</sup> The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer; 

<sup>26</sup> The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks; 

<sup>27</sup> The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands; 

<sup>28</sup> The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings’ palaces. 

<sup>29</sup> There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going: 

<sup>30</sup> A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any; 

<sup>31</sup> A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up. 

<sup>32</sup> If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth. 

<sup>33</sup> Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.
