# Proverbs 10 

**¹** The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son *is* the heaviness of his mother. 

**²** Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death. 

**³** The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked. 

**⁴** He becometh poor that dealeth *with* a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. 

**⁵** He that gathereth in summer *is* a wise son: *but* he that sleepeth in harvest *is* a son that causeth shame. 

**⁶** Blessings *are* upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. 

**⁷** The memory of the just *is* blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot. 

**⁸** The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall. 

**⁹** He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known. 

**¹⁰** He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall. 

**¹¹** The mouth of a righteous *man is* a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. 

**¹²** Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins. 

**¹³** In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod *is* for the back of him that is void of understanding. 

**¹⁴** Wise *men* lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish *is* near destruction. 

**¹⁵** The rich man’s wealth *is* his strong city: the destruction of the poor *is* their poverty. 

**¹⁶** The labour of the righteous *tendeth* to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin. 

**¹⁷** He *is in* the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth. 

**¹⁸** He that hideth hatred *with* lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, *is* a fool. 

**¹⁹** In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips *is* wise. 

**²⁰** The tongue of the just *is as* choice silver: the heart of the wicked *is* little worth. 

**²¹** The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom. 

**²²** The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it. 

**²³** *It is* as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom. 

**²⁴** The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted. 

**²⁵** As the whirlwind passeth, so *is* the wicked no *more:* but the righteous *is* an everlasting foundation. 

**²⁶** As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so *is* the sluggard to them that send him. 

**²⁷** The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened. 

**²⁸** The hope of the righteous *shall be* gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish. 

**²⁹** The way of the LORD *is* strength to the upright: but destruction *shall be* to the workers of iniquity. 

**³⁰** The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth. 

**³¹** The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out. 

**³²** The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked *speaketh* frowardness.
