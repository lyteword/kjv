# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> My son, attend unto my wisdom, *and* bow thine ear to my understanding: 

<sup>2</sup> That thou mayest regard discretion, and *that* thy lips may keep knowledge. 

<sup>3</sup> ¶ For the lips of a strange woman drop *as* an honeycomb, and her mouth *is* smoother than oil: 

<sup>4</sup> But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword. 

<sup>5</sup> Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. 

<sup>6</sup> Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, *that* thou canst not know *them*. 

<sup>7</sup> Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. 

<sup>8</sup> Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house: 

<sup>9</sup> Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel: 

<sup>10</sup> Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours *be* in the house of a stranger; 

<sup>11</sup> And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, 

<sup>12</sup> And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; 

<sup>13</sup> And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me! 

<sup>14</sup> I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly. 

<sup>15</sup> ¶ Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. 

<sup>16</sup> Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, *and* rivers of waters in the streets. 

<sup>17</sup> Let them be only thine own, and not strangers’ with thee. 

<sup>18</sup> Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. 

<sup>19</sup> *Let her be as* the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. 

<sup>20</sup> And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? 

<sup>21</sup> For the ways of man *are* before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. 

<sup>22</sup> ¶ His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. 

<sup>23</sup> He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
