# Proverbs 25 

**¹** These *are* also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. 

**²** *It is* the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings *is* to search out a matter. 

**³** The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings *is* unsearchable. 

**⁴** Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer. 

**⁵** Take away the wicked *from* before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness. 

**⁶** Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great *men:* 

**⁷** For better *it is* that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen. 

**⁸** Go not forth hastily to strive, lest *thou know not* what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame. 

**⁹** Debate thy cause with thy neighbour *himself;* and discover not a secret to another: 

**¹⁰** Lest he that heareth *it* put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away. 

**¹¹** A word fitly spoken *is like* apples of gold in pictures of silver. 

**¹²** *As* an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, *so is* a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. 

**¹³** As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, *so is* a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters. 

**¹⁴** Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift *is like* clouds and wind without rain. 

**¹⁵** By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone. 

**¹⁶** Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it. 

**¹⁷** Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour’s house; lest he be weary of thee, and *so* hate thee. 

**¹⁸** A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour *is* a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow. 

**¹⁹** Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble *is like* a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint. 

**²⁰** *As* he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, *and as* vinegar upon nitre, so *is* he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. 

**²¹** If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: 

**²²** For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee. 

**²³** The north wind driveth away rain: so *doth* an angry countenance a backbiting tongue. 

**²⁴** *It is* better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house. 

**²⁵** *As* cold waters to a thirsty soul, so *is* good news from a far country. 

**²⁶** A righteous man falling down before the wicked *is as* a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring. 

**²⁷** *It is* not good to eat much honey: so *for men* to search their own glory *is not* glory. 

**²⁸** He that *hath* no rule over his own spirit *is like* a city *that is* broken down, *and* without walls.
