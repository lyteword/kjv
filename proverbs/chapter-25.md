# Chapter 25

<sup>1</sup> These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. 

<sup>2</sup> It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter. 

<sup>3</sup> The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable. 

<sup>4</sup> Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer. 

<sup>5</sup> Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness. 

<sup>6</sup> Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men: 

<sup>7</sup> For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen. 

<sup>8</sup> Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame. 

<sup>9</sup> Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another: 

<sup>10</sup> Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away. 

<sup>11</sup> A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. 

<sup>12</sup> As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. 

<sup>13</sup> As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters. 

<sup>14</sup> Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain. 

<sup>15</sup> By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone. 

<sup>16</sup> Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it. 

<sup>17</sup> Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbourâ€™s house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee. 

<sup>18</sup> A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow. 

<sup>19</sup> Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint. 

<sup>20</sup> As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. 

<sup>21</sup> If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: 

<sup>22</sup> For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee. 

<sup>23</sup> The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue. 

<sup>24</sup> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house. 

<sup>25</sup> As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country. 

<sup>26</sup> A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring. 

<sup>27</sup> It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory. 

<sup>28</sup> He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.
