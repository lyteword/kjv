# Chapter 1

**¹** The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; 

**²** To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; 

**³** To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; 

**⁴** To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. 

**⁵** A wise *man* will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: 

**⁶** To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. 

**⁷** ¶ The fear of the LORD *is* the beginning of knowledge: *but* fools despise wisdom and instruction. 

**⁸** My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: 

**⁹** For they *shall be* an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. 

**¹⁰** ¶ My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. 

**¹¹** If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause: 

**¹²** Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit: 

**¹³** We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil: 

**¹⁴** Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse: 

**¹⁵** My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path: 

**¹⁶** For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. 

**¹⁷** Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. 

**¹⁸** And they lay wait for their *own* blood; they lurk privily for their *own* lives. 

**¹⁹** So *are* the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; *which* taketh away the life of the owners thereof. 

**²⁰** ¶ Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: 

**²¹** She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, *saying*, 

**²²** How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? 

**²³** Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. 

**²⁴** ¶ Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; 

**²⁵** But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: 

**²⁶** I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; 

**²⁷** When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. 

**²⁸** Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: 

**²⁹** For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: 

**³⁰** They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. 

**³¹** Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. 

**³²** For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. 

**³³** But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.
