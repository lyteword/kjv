# Proverbs 12 

**¹** Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof *is* brutish. 

**²** A good *man* obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn. 

**³** A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved. 

**⁴** A virtuous woman *is* a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed *is* as rottenness in his bones. 

**⁵** The thoughts of the righteous *are* right: *but* the counsels of the wicked *are* deceit. 

**⁶** The words of the wicked *are* to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them. 

**⁷** The wicked are overthrown, and *are* not: but the house of the righteous shall stand. 

**⁸** A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised. 

**⁹** *He that is* despised, and hath a servant, *is* better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread. 

**¹⁰** A righteous *man* regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked *are* cruel. 

**¹¹** He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain *persons is* void of understanding. 

**¹²** The wicked desireth the net of evil *men:* but the root of the righteous yieldeth *fruit*. 

**¹³** The wicked is snared by the transgression of *his* lips: but the just shall come out of trouble. 

**¹⁴** A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of *his* mouth: and the recompence of a man’s hands shall be rendered unto him. 

**¹⁵** The way of a fool *is* right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel *is* wise. 

**¹⁶** A fool’s wrath is presently known: but a prudent *man* covereth shame. 

**¹⁷** *He that* speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit. 

**¹⁸** There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise *is* health. 

**¹⁹** The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue *is* but for a moment. 

**²⁰** Deceit *is* in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace *is* joy. 

**²¹** There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief. 

**²²** Lying lips *are* abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly *are* his delight. 

**²³** A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness. 

**²⁴** The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute. 

**²⁵** Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad. 

**²⁶** The righteous *is* more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them. 

**²⁷** The slothful *man* roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man *is* precious. 

**²⁸** In the way of righteousness *is* life; and *in* the pathway *thereof there is* no death.
