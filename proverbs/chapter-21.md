# Chapter 21

<sup>1</sup> The kingâ€™s heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will. 

<sup>2</sup> Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts. 

<sup>3</sup> To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice. 

<sup>4</sup> An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is sin. 

<sup>5</sup> The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want. 

<sup>6</sup> The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death. 

<sup>7</sup> The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment. 

<sup>8</sup> The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work is right. 

<sup>9</sup> It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house. 

<sup>10</sup> The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes. 

<sup>11</sup> When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge. 

<sup>12</sup> The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness. 

<sup>13</sup> Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard. 

<sup>14</sup> A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath. 

<sup>15</sup> It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity. 

<sup>16</sup> The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead. 

<sup>17</sup> He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich. 

<sup>18</sup> The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright. 

<sup>19</sup> It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman. 

<sup>20</sup> There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up. 

<sup>21</sup> He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour. 

<sup>22</sup> A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof. 

<sup>23</sup> Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles. 

<sup>24</sup> Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath. 

<sup>25</sup> The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour. 

<sup>26</sup> He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not. 

<sup>27</sup> The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind? 

<sup>28</sup> A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly. 

<sup>29</sup> A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he directeth his way. 

<sup>30</sup> There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD. 

<sup>31</sup> The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is of the LORD.
