# Chapter 21

**¹** The king’s heart *is* in the hand of the LORD, *as* the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will. 

**²** Every way of a man *is* right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts. 

**³** To do justice and judgment *is* more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice. 

**⁴** An high look, and a proud heart, *and* the plowing of the wicked, *is* sin. 

**⁵** The thoughts of the diligent *tend* only to plenteousness; but of every one *that is* hasty only to want. 

**⁶** The getting of treasures by a lying tongue *is* a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death. 

**⁷** The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment. 

**⁸** The way of man *is* froward and strange: but *as for* the pure, his work *is* right. 

**⁹** *It is* better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house. 

**¹⁰** The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes. 

**¹¹** When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge. 

**¹²** The righteous *man* wisely considereth the house of the wicked: *but God* overthroweth the wicked for *their* wickedness. 

**¹³** Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard. 

**¹⁴** A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath. 

**¹⁵** *It is* joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction *shall be* to the workers of iniquity. 

**¹⁶** The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead. 

**¹⁷** He that loveth pleasure *shall be* a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich. 

**¹⁸** The wicked *shall be* a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright. 

**¹⁹** *It is* better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman. 

**²⁰** *There is* treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up. 

**²¹** He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour. 

**²²** A wise *man* scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof. 

**²³** Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles. 

**²⁴** Proud *and* haughty scorner *is* his name, who dealeth in proud wrath. 

**²⁵** The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour. 

**²⁶** He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not. 

**²⁷** The sacrifice of the wicked *is* abomination: how much more, *when* he bringeth it with a wicked mind? 

**²⁸** A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly. 

**²⁹** A wicked man hardeneth his face: but *as for* the upright, he directeth his way. 

**³⁰** *There is* no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD. 

**³¹** The horse *is* prepared against the day of battle: but safety *is* of the LORD.
