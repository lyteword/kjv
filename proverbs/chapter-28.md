# Proverbs 28 

**¹** The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion. 

**²** For the transgression of a land many *are* the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding *and* knowledge the state *thereof* shall be prolonged. 

**³** A poor man that oppresseth the poor *is like* a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. 

**⁴** They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them. 

**⁵** Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all *things*. 

**⁶** Better *is* the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than *he that is* perverse *in his* ways, though he *be* rich. 

**⁷** Whoso keepeth the law *is* a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous *men* shameth his father. 

**⁸** He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor. 

**⁹** He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer *shall be* abomination. 

**¹⁰** Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good *things* in possession. 

**¹¹** The rich man *is* wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out. 

**¹²** When righteous *men* do rejoice, *there is* great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden. 

**¹³** He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh *them* shall have mercy. 

**¹⁴** Happy *is* the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. 

**¹⁵** *As* a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; *so is* a wicked ruler over the poor people. 

**¹⁶** The prince that wanteth understanding *is* also a great oppressor: *but* he that hateth covetousness shall prolong *his* days. 

**¹⁷** A man that doeth violence to the blood of *any* person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him. 

**¹⁸** Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but *he that is* perverse *in his* ways shall fall at once. 

**¹⁹** He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain *persons* shall have poverty enough. 

**²⁰** A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent. 

**²¹** To have respect of persons *is* not good: for for a piece of bread *that* man will transgress. 

**²²** He that hasteth to be rich *hath* an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him. 

**²³** He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue. 

**²⁴** Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, *It is* no transgression; the same *is* the companion of a destroyer. 

**²⁵** He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat. 

**²⁶** He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered. 

**²⁷** He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse. 

**²⁸** When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.
