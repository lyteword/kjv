# Proverbs 27 

**¹** Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. 

**²** Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips. 

**³** A stone *is* heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool’s wrath *is* heavier than them both. 

**⁴** Wrath *is* cruel, and anger *is* outrageous; but who *is* able to stand before envy? 

**⁵** Open rebuke *is* better than secret love. 

**⁶** Faithful *are* the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy *are* deceitful. 

**⁷** The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. 

**⁸** As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so *is* a man that wandereth from his place. 

**⁹** Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so *doth* the sweetness of a man’s friend by hearty counsel. 

**¹⁰** Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity: *for* better *is* a neighbour *that is* near than a brother far off. 

**¹¹** My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me. 

**¹²** A prudent *man* foreseeth the evil, *and* hideth himself; *but* the simple pass on, *and* are punished. 

**¹³** Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. 

**¹⁴** He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him. 

**¹⁵** A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike. 

**¹⁶** Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, *which* bewrayeth *itself*. 

**¹⁷** Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. 

**¹⁸** Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured. 

**¹⁹** As in water face *answereth* to face, so the heart of man to man. 

**²⁰** Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied. 

**²¹** *As* the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so *is* a man to his praise. 

**²²** Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, *yet* will not his foolishness depart from him. 

**²³** Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, *and* look well to thy herds. 

**²⁴** For riches *are* not for ever: and doth the crown *endure* to every generation? 

**²⁵** The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered. 

**²⁶** The lambs *are* for thy clothing, and the goats *are* the price of the field. 

**²⁷** And *thou shalt have* goats’ milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and *for* the maintenance for thy maidens.
