# Proverbs 2 

**¹** My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; 

**²** So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, *and* apply thine heart to understanding; 

**³** Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, *and* liftest up thy voice for understanding; 

**⁴** If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as *for* hid treasures; 

**⁵** Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. 

**⁶** For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth *cometh* knowledge and understanding. 

**⁷** He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: *he is* a buckler to them that walk uprightly. 

**⁸** He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints. 

**⁹** Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; *yea*, every good path. 

**¹⁰** ¶ When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; 

**¹¹** Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee: 

**¹²** To deliver thee from the way of the evil *man*, from the man that speaketh froward things; 

**¹³** Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; 

**¹⁴** Who rejoice to do evil, *and* delight in the frowardness of the wicked; 

**¹⁵** Whose ways *are* crooked, and *they* froward in their paths: 

**¹⁶** To deliver thee from the strange woman, *even* from the stranger *which* flattereth with her words; 

**¹⁷** Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. 

**¹⁸** For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead. 

**¹⁹** None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life. 

**²⁰** That thou mayest walk in the way of good *men*, and keep the paths of the righteous. 

**²¹** For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it. 

**²²** But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
