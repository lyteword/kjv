# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; 

<sup>2</sup> So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, *and* apply thine heart to understanding; 

<sup>3</sup> Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, *and* liftest up thy voice for understanding; 

<sup>4</sup> If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as *for* hid treasures; 

<sup>5</sup> Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. 

<sup>6</sup> For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth *cometh* knowledge and understanding. 

<sup>7</sup> He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: *he is* a buckler to them that walk uprightly. 

<sup>8</sup> He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints. 

<sup>9</sup> Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; *yea*, every good path. 

<sup>10</sup> ¶ When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; 

<sup>11</sup> Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee: 

<sup>12</sup> To deliver thee from the way of the evil *man*, from the man that speaketh froward things; 

<sup>13</sup> Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; 

<sup>14</sup> Who rejoice to do evil, *and* delight in the frowardness of the wicked; 

<sup>15</sup> Whose ways *are* crooked, and *they* froward in their paths: 

<sup>16</sup> To deliver thee from the strange woman, *even* from the stranger *which* flattereth with her words; 

<sup>17</sup> Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. 

<sup>18</sup> For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead. 

<sup>19</sup> None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life. 

<sup>20</sup> That thou mayest walk in the way of good *men*, and keep the paths of the righteous. 

<sup>21</sup> For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it. 

<sup>22</sup> But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
