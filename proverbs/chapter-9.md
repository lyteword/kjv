# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars: 

<sup>2</sup> She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table. 

<sup>3</sup> She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city, 

<sup>4</sup> Whoso *is* simple, let him turn in hither: *as for* him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, 

<sup>5</sup> Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine *which* I have mingled. 

<sup>6</sup> Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding. 

<sup>7</sup> He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked *man getteth* himself a blot. 

<sup>8</sup> Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee. 

<sup>9</sup> Give *instruction* to a wise *man*, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just *man*, and he will increase in learning. 

<sup>10</sup> The fear of the LORD *is* the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy *is* understanding. 

<sup>11</sup> For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased. 

<sup>12</sup> If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but *if* thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear *it*. 

<sup>13</sup> ¶ A foolish woman *is* clamorous: *she is* simple, and knoweth nothing. 

<sup>14</sup> For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city, 

<sup>15</sup> To call passengers who go right on their ways: 

<sup>16</sup> Whoso *is* simple, let him turn in hither: and *as for* him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, 

<sup>17</sup> Stolen waters are sweet, and bread *eaten* in secret is pleasant. 

<sup>18</sup> But he knoweth not that the dead *are* there; *and that* her guests *are* in the depths of hell.
