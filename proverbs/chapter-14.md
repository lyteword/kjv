# Proverbs 14 

**¹** Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands. 

**²** He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but *he that is* perverse in his ways despiseth him. 

**³** In the mouth of the foolish *is* a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them. 

**⁴** Where no oxen *are*, the crib *is* clean: but much increase *is* by the strength of the ox. 

**⁵** A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies. 

**⁶** A scorner seeketh wisdom, and *findeth it* not: but knowledge *is* easy unto him that understandeth. 

**⁷** Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not *in him* the lips of knowledge. 

**⁸** The wisdom of the prudent *is* to understand his way: but the folly of fools *is* deceit. 

**⁹** Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous *there is* favour. 

**¹⁰** The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy. 

**¹¹** The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish. 

**¹²** There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof *are* the ways of death. 

**¹³** Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth *is* heaviness. 

**¹⁴** The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man *shall be satisfied* from himself. 

**¹⁵** The simple believeth every word: but the prudent *man* looketh well to his going. 

**¹⁶** A wise *man* feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident. 

**¹⁷** *He that is* soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated. 

**¹⁸** The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. 

**¹⁹** The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous. 

**²⁰** The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich *hath* many friends. 

**²¹** He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy *is* he. 

**²²** Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth *shall be* to them that devise good. 

**²³** In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips *tendeth* only to penury. 

**²⁴** The crown of the wise *is* their riches: *but* the foolishness of fools *is* folly. 

**²⁵** A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful *witness* speaketh lies. 

**²⁶** In the fear of the LORD *is* strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge. 

**²⁷** The fear of the LORD *is* a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death. 

**²⁸** In the multitude of people *is* the king’s honour: but in the want of people *is* the destruction of the prince. 

**²⁹** *He that is* slow to wrath *is* of great understanding: but *he that is* hasty of spirit exalteth folly. 

**³⁰** A sound heart *is* the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones. 

**³¹** He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor. 

**³²** The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death. 

**³³** Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but *that which is* in the midst of fools is made known. 

**³⁴** Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin *is* a reproach to any people. 

**³⁵** The king’s favour *is* toward a wise servant: but his wrath is *against* him that causeth shame.
