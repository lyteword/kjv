# Chapter 14

<sup>1</sup> Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands. 

<sup>2</sup> He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but *he that is* perverse in his ways despiseth him. 

<sup>3</sup> In the mouth of the foolish *is* a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them. 

<sup>4</sup> Where no oxen *are*, the crib *is* clean: but much increase *is* by the strength of the ox. 

<sup>5</sup> A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies. 

<sup>6</sup> A scorner seeketh wisdom, and *findeth it* not: but knowledge *is* easy unto him that understandeth. 

<sup>7</sup> Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not *in him* the lips of knowledge. 

<sup>8</sup> The wisdom of the prudent *is* to understand his way: but the folly of fools *is* deceit. 

<sup>9</sup> Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous *there is* favour. 

<sup>10</sup> The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy. 

<sup>11</sup> The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish. 

<sup>12</sup> There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof *are* the ways of death. 

<sup>13</sup> Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth *is* heaviness. 

<sup>14</sup> The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man *shall be satisfied* from himself. 

<sup>15</sup> The simple believeth every word: but the prudent *man* looketh well to his going. 

<sup>16</sup> A wise *man* feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident. 

<sup>17</sup> *He that is* soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated. 

<sup>18</sup> The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. 

<sup>19</sup> The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous. 

<sup>20</sup> The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich *hath* many friends. 

<sup>21</sup> He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy *is* he. 

<sup>22</sup> Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth *shall be* to them that devise good. 

<sup>23</sup> In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips *tendeth* only to penury. 

<sup>24</sup> The crown of the wise *is* their riches: *but* the foolishness of fools *is* folly. 

<sup>25</sup> A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful *witness* speaketh lies. 

<sup>26</sup> In the fear of the LORD *is* strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge. 

<sup>27</sup> The fear of the LORD *is* a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death. 

<sup>28</sup> In the multitude of people *is* the king’s honour: but in the want of people *is* the destruction of the prince. 

<sup>29</sup> *He that is* slow to wrath *is* of great understanding: but *he that is* hasty of spirit exalteth folly. 

<sup>30</sup> A sound heart *is* the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones. 

<sup>31</sup> He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor. 

<sup>32</sup> The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death. 

<sup>33</sup> Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but *that which is* in the midst of fools is made known. 

<sup>34</sup> Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin *is* a reproach to any people. 

<sup>35</sup> The king’s favour *is* toward a wise servant: but his wrath is *against* him that causeth shame.
