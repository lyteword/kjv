# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, *is* from the LORD. 

<sup>2</sup> All the ways of a man *are* clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits. 

<sup>3</sup> Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established. 

<sup>4</sup> The LORD hath made all *things* for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. 

<sup>5</sup> Every one *that is* proud in heart *is* an abomination to the LORD: *though* hand *join* in hand, he shall not be unpunished. 

<sup>6</sup> By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD *men* depart from evil. 

<sup>7</sup> When a man’s ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. 

<sup>8</sup> Better *is* a little with righteousness than great revenues without right. 

<sup>9</sup> A man’s heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps. 

<sup>10</sup> A divine sentence *is* in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment. 

<sup>11</sup> A just weight and balance *are* the LORD’s: all the weights of the bag *are* his work. 

<sup>12</sup> *It is* an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness. 

<sup>13</sup> Righteous lips *are* the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right. 

<sup>14</sup> The wrath of a king *is as* messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it. 

<sup>15</sup> In the light of the king’s countenance *is* life; and his favour *is* as a cloud of the latter rain. 

<sup>16</sup> How much better *is it* to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver! 

<sup>17</sup> The highway of the upright *is* to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul. 

<sup>18</sup> Pride *goeth* before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall. 

<sup>19</sup> Better *it is to be* of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud. 

<sup>20</sup> He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy *is* he. 

<sup>21</sup> The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning. 

<sup>22</sup> Understanding *is* a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools *is* folly. 

<sup>23</sup> The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips. 

<sup>24</sup> Pleasant words *are as* an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. 

<sup>25</sup> There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof *are* the ways of death. 

<sup>26</sup> He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him. 

<sup>27</sup> An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips *there is* as a burning fire. 

<sup>28</sup> A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends. 

<sup>29</sup> A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way *that is* not good. 

<sup>30</sup> He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass. 

<sup>31</sup> The hoary head *is* a crown of glory, *if* it be found in the way of righteousness. 

<sup>32</sup> *He that is* slow to anger *is* better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city. 

<sup>33</sup> The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof *is* of the LORD.
