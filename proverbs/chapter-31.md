# Proverbs 31 

**¹** The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him. 

**²** What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows? 

**³** Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings. 

**⁴** *It is* not for kings, O Lemuel, *it is* not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink: 

**⁵** Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted. 

**⁶** Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts. 

**⁷** Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. 

**⁸** Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. 

**⁹** Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy. 

**¹⁰** ¶ Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price *is* far above rubies. 

**¹¹** The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil. 

**¹²** She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. 

**¹³** She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. 

**¹⁴** She is like the merchants’ ships; she bringeth her food from afar. 

**¹⁵** She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens. 

**¹⁶** She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. 

**¹⁷** She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms. 

**¹⁸** She perceiveth that her merchandise *is* good: her candle goeth not out by night. 

**¹⁹** She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. 

**²⁰** She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. 

**²¹** She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household *are* clothed with scarlet. 

**²²** She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing *is* silk and purple. 

**²³** Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. 

**²⁴** She maketh fine linen, and selleth *it;* and delivereth girdles unto the merchant. 

**²⁵** Strength and honour *are* her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. 

**²⁶** She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue *is* the law of kindness. 

**²⁷** She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. 

**²⁸** Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband *also*, and he praiseth her. 

**²⁹** Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. 

**³⁰** Favour *is* deceitful, and beauty *is* vain: *but* a woman *that* feareth the LORD, she shall be praised. 

**³¹** Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.
