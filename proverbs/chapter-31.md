# Chapter 31

<sup>1</sup> The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him. 

<sup>2</sup> What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows? 

<sup>3</sup> Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings. 

<sup>4</sup> It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink: 

<sup>5</sup> Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted. 

<sup>6</sup> Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts. 

<sup>7</sup> Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. 

<sup>8</sup> Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. 

<sup>9</sup> Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy. 

<sup>10</sup> ¶ Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies. 

<sup>11</sup> The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil. 

<sup>12</sup> She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. 

<sup>13</sup> She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. 

<sup>14</sup> She is like the merchants’ ships; she bringeth her food from afar. 

<sup>15</sup> She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens. 

<sup>16</sup> She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. 

<sup>17</sup> She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms. 

<sup>18</sup> She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night. 

<sup>19</sup> She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. 

<sup>20</sup> She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. 

<sup>21</sup> She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet. 

<sup>22</sup> She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple. 

<sup>23</sup> Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. 

<sup>24</sup> She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant. 

<sup>25</sup> Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. 

<sup>26</sup> She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. 

<sup>27</sup> She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. 

<sup>28</sup> Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. 

<sup>29</sup> Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. 

<sup>30</sup> Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised. 

<sup>31</sup> Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.
