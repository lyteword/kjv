# Chapter 17

<sup>1</sup> Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife. 

<sup>2</sup> A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren. 

<sup>3</sup> The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts. 

<sup>4</sup> A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue. 

<sup>5</sup> Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished. 

<sup>6</sup> Childrenâ€™s children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers. 

<sup>7</sup> Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince. 

<sup>8</sup> A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth. 

<sup>9</sup> He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends. 

<sup>10</sup> A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool. 

<sup>11</sup> An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him. 

<sup>12</sup> Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly. 

<sup>13</sup> Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house. 

<sup>14</sup> The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with. 

<sup>15</sup> He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD. 

<sup>16</sup> Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it? 

<sup>17</sup> A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. 

<sup>18</sup> A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend. 

<sup>19</sup> He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction. 

<sup>20</sup> He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief. 

<sup>21</sup> He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy. 

<sup>22</sup> A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones. 

<sup>23</sup> A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment. 

<sup>24</sup> Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth. 

<sup>25</sup> A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him. 

<sup>26</sup> Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity. 

<sup>27</sup> He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit. 

<sup>28</sup> Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.
