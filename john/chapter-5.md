# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 

<sup>2</sup> Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. 

<sup>3</sup> In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. 

<sup>4</sup> For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. 

<sup>5</sup> And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. 

<sup>6</sup> When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? 

<sup>7</sup> The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. 

<sup>8</sup> Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. 

<sup>9</sup> And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath. 

<sup>10</sup> ¶ The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. 

<sup>11</sup> He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. 

<sup>12</sup> Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk? 

<sup>13</sup> And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. 

<sup>14</sup> Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. 

<sup>15</sup> The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole. 

<sup>16</sup> And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day. 

<sup>17</sup> ¶ But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. 

<sup>18</sup> Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God. 

<sup>19</sup> Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. 

<sup>20</sup> For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. 

<sup>21</sup> For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. 

<sup>22</sup> For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: 

<sup>23</sup> That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. 

<sup>24</sup> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 

<sup>25</sup> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. 

<sup>26</sup> For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; 

<sup>27</sup> And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. 

<sup>28</sup> Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, 

<sup>29</sup> And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. 

<sup>30</sup> I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me. 

<sup>31</sup> If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. 

<sup>32</sup> ¶ There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. 

<sup>33</sup> Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth. 

<sup>34</sup> But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved. 

<sup>35</sup> He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. 

<sup>36</sup> ¶ But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. 

<sup>37</sup> And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. 

<sup>38</sup> And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. 

<sup>39</sup> ¶ Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. 

<sup>40</sup> And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. 

<sup>41</sup> I receive not honour from men. 

<sup>42</sup> But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. 

<sup>43</sup> I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. 

<sup>44</sup> How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only? 

<sup>45</sup> Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. 

<sup>46</sup> For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. 

<sup>47</sup> But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
