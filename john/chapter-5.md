# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 

<sup>2</sup> Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep *market* a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. 

<sup>3</sup> In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. 

<sup>4</sup> For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. 

<sup>5</sup> And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. 

<sup>6</sup> When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time *in that case*, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole ? 

<sup>7</sup> The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. 

<sup>8</sup> Jesus saith unto him, Rise , take up thy bed , and walk . 

<sup>9</sup> And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath. 

<sup>10</sup> ¶ The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry *thy* bed. 

<sup>11</sup> He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. 

<sup>12</sup> Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk? 

<sup>13</sup> And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in *that* place. 

<sup>14</sup> Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold , thou art made whole : sin no more , lest a worse thing come unto thee . 

<sup>15</sup> The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole. 

<sup>16</sup> And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day. 

<sup>17</sup> ¶ But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto , and I work . 

<sup>18</sup> Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God. 

<sup>19</sup> Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily , verily , I say unto you , The Son can do nothing of himself , but what he seeth the Father do : for what things soever he doeth , these also doeth the Son likewise . 

<sup>20</sup> For the Father loveth the Son , and sheweth him all things that himself doeth : and he will shew him greater works than these , that ye may marvel . 

<sup>21</sup> For as the Father raiseth up the dead , and quickeneth *them* ; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will . 

<sup>22</sup> For the Father judgeth no man , but hath committed all judgment unto the Son : 

<sup>23</sup> That all *men* should honour the Son , even as they honour the Father . He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him . 

<sup>24</sup> Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that heareth my word , and believeth on him that sent me , hath everlasting life , and shall not come into condemnation ; but is passed from death unto life . 

<sup>25</sup> Verily , verily , I say unto you , The hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God : and they that hear shall live . 

<sup>26</sup> For as the Father hath life in himself ; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself ; 

<sup>27</sup> And hath given him authority to execute judgment also , because he is the Son of man . 

<sup>28</sup> Marvel not at this : for the hour is coming , in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice , 

<sup>29</sup> And shall come forth ; they that have done good , unto the resurrection of life ; and they that have done evil , unto the resurrection of damnation . 

<sup>30</sup> I can of mine own self do nothing : as I hear , I judge : and my judgment is just ; because I seek not mine own will , but the will of the Father which hath sent me . 

<sup>31</sup> If I bear witness of myself , my witness is not true . 

<sup>32</sup> ¶ There is another that beareth witness of me ; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true . 

<sup>33</sup> Ye sent unto John , and he bare witness unto the truth . 

<sup>34</sup> But I receive not testimony from man : but these things I say , that ye might be saved . 

<sup>35</sup> He was a burning and a shining light : and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light . 

<sup>36</sup> ¶ But I have greater witness than that of John : for the works which the Father hath given me to finish , the same works that I do , bear witness of me , that the Father hath sent me . 

<sup>37</sup> And the Father himself , which hath sent me , hath borne witness of me . Ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his shape . 

<sup>38</sup> And ye have not his word abiding in you : for whom he hath sent , him ye believe not . 

<sup>39</sup> ¶ Search the scriptures ; for in them ye think ye have eternal life : and they are they which testify of me . 

<sup>40</sup> And ye will not come to me , that ye might have life . 

<sup>41</sup> I receive not honour from men . 

<sup>42</sup> But I know you , that ye have not the love of God in you . 

<sup>43</sup> I am come in my Father’s name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive . 

<sup>44</sup> How can ye believe , which receive honour one of another , and seek not the honour that *cometh* from God only ? 

<sup>45</sup> Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father : there is *one* that accuseth you , *even* Moses , in whom ye trust . 

<sup>46</sup> For had ye believed Moses , ye would have believed me : for he wrote of me . 

<sup>47</sup> But if ye believe not his writings , how shall ye believe my words ?
