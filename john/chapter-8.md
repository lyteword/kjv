# John 8 

**¹** Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. 

**²** And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them. 

**³** And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, 

**⁴** They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. 

**⁵** Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? 

**⁶** This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with *his* finger wrote on the ground, *as though he heard them not*. 

**⁷** So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.

**⁸** And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. 

**⁹** And they which heard *it*, being convicted by *their own* conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, *even* unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. 

**¹⁰** When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?

**¹¹** She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.

**¹²** ¶ Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.

**¹³** The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true. 

**¹⁴** Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, *yet* my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.

**¹⁵** Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.

**¹⁶** And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.

**¹⁷** It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.

**¹⁸** I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.

**¹⁹** Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.

**²⁰** These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come. 

**²¹** Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.

**²²** Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come. 

**²³** And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.

**²⁴** I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am *he*, ye shall die in your sins.

**²⁵** Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even *the same* that I said unto you from the beginning.

**²⁶** I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.

**²⁷** They understood not that he spake to them of the Father. 

**²⁸** Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am *he*, and *that* I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.

**²⁹** And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.

**³⁰** As he spake these words, many believed on him. 

**³¹** Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, *then* are ye my disciples indeed;

**³²** And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.

**³³** ¶ They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? 

**³⁴** Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.

**³⁵** And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: *but* the Son abideth ever.

**³⁶** If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.

**³⁷** I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.

**³⁸** I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.

**³⁹** They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.

**⁴⁰** But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.

**⁴¹** Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, *even* God. 

**⁴²** Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.

**⁴³** Why do ye not understand my speech? *even* because ye cannot hear my word.

**⁴⁴** Ye are of *your* father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.

**⁴⁵** And because I tell *you* the truth, ye believe me not.

**⁴⁶** Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?

**⁴⁷** He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear *them* not, because ye are not of God.

**⁴⁸** Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? 

**⁴⁹** Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.

**⁵⁰** And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.

**⁵¹** Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.

**⁵²** Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death. 

**⁵³** Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself? 

**⁵⁴** Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:

**⁵⁵** Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.

**⁵⁶** Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw *it*, and was glad.

**⁵⁷** Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? 

**⁵⁸** Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.

**⁵⁹** Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.
