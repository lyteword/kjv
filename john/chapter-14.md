# Chapter 14

<sup>1</sup> Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. 

<sup>2</sup> In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 

<sup>3</sup> And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. 

<sup>4</sup> And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. 

<sup>5</sup> Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? 

<sup>6</sup> Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. 

<sup>7</sup> If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. 

<sup>8</sup> Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. 

<sup>9</sup> Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? 

<sup>10</sup> Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. 

<sup>11</sup> Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake. 

<sup>12</sup> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. 

<sup>13</sup> And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 

<sup>14</sup> If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. 

<sup>15</sup> ¶ If ye love me, keep my commandments. 

<sup>16</sup> And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; 

<sup>17</sup> Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. 

<sup>18</sup> I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. 

<sup>19</sup> Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also. 

<sup>20</sup> At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. 

<sup>21</sup> He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. 

<sup>22</sup> Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? 

<sup>23</sup> Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. 

<sup>24</sup> He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s which sent me. 

<sup>25</sup> These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. 

<sup>26</sup> But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. 

<sup>27</sup> Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. 

<sup>28</sup> Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I. 

<sup>29</sup> And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe. 

<sup>30</sup> Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. 

<sup>31</sup> But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.
