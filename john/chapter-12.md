# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. 

<sup>2</sup> There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. 

<sup>3</sup> Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. 

<sup>4</sup> Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s *son*, which should betray him, 

<sup>5</sup> Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? 

<sup>6</sup> This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. 

<sup>7</sup> Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.

<sup>8</sup> For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.

<sup>9</sup> Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. 

<sup>10</sup> ¶ But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; 

<sup>11</sup> Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus. 

<sup>12</sup> ¶ On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 

<sup>13</sup> Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed *is* the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord. 

<sup>14</sup> And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, 

<sup>15</sup> Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt. 

<sup>16</sup> These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and *that* they had done these things unto him. 

<sup>17</sup> The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record. 

<sup>18</sup> For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle. 

<sup>19</sup> The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him. 

<sup>20</sup> ¶ And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast: 

<sup>21</sup> The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. 

<sup>22</sup> Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. 

<sup>23</sup> ¶ And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.

<sup>24</sup> Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.

<sup>25</sup> He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.

<sup>26</sup> If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will *my* Father honour.

<sup>27</sup> Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.

<sup>28</sup> Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, *saying*, I have both glorified *it*, and will glorify *it* again. 

<sup>29</sup> The people therefore, that stood by, and heard *it*, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. 

<sup>30</sup> Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.

<sup>31</sup> Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.

<sup>32</sup> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all *men* unto me.

<sup>33</sup> This he said, signifying what death he should die. 

<sup>34</sup> The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man? 

<sup>35</sup> Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.

<sup>36</sup> While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them. 

<sup>37</sup> ¶ But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him: 

<sup>38</sup> That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? 

<sup>39</sup> Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again, 

<sup>40</sup> He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with *their* eyes, nor understand with *their* heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. 

<sup>41</sup> These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him. 

<sup>42</sup> ¶ Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess *him*, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: 

<sup>43</sup> For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. 

<sup>44</sup> ¶ Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.

<sup>45</sup> And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.

<sup>46</sup> I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.

<sup>47</sup> And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.

<sup>48</sup> He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.

<sup>49</sup> For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.

<sup>50</sup> And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.
