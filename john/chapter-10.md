# Chapter 10

**¹** Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.

**²** But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

**³** To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.

**⁴** And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.

**⁵** And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.

**⁶** This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. 

**⁷** Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.

**⁸** All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.

**⁹** I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.

**¹⁰** The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have *it* more abundantly.

**¹¹** I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.

**¹²** But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.

**¹³** The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.

**¹⁴** I am the good shepherd, and know my *sheep*, and am known of mine.

**¹⁵** As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.

**¹⁶** And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, *and* one shepherd.

**¹⁷** Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.

**¹⁸** No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.

**¹⁹** ¶ There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings. 

**²⁰** And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? 

**²¹** Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind? 

**²²** ¶ And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter. 

**²³** And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch. 

**²⁴** Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. 

**²⁵** Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me.

**²⁶** But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.

**²⁷** My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:

**²⁸** And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any *man* pluck them out of my hand.

**²⁹** My Father, which gave *them* me, is greater than all; and no *man* is able to pluck *them* out of my Father’s hand.

**³⁰** I and *my* Father are one.

**³¹** Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. 

**³²** Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?

**³³** The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. 

**³⁴** Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?

**³⁵** If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture can not be broken;

**³⁶** Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?

**³⁷** If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.

**³⁸** But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father *is* in me, and I in him.

**³⁹** Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand, 

**⁴⁰** And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode. 

**⁴¹** And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true. 

**⁴²** And many believed on him there.
