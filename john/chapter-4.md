# Chapter 4

**¹** When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, 

**²** (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) 

**³** He left Judæa, and departed again into Galilee. 

**⁴** And he must needs go through Samaria. 

**⁵** Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 

**⁶** Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with *his* journey, sat thus on the well: *and* it was about the sixth hour. 

**⁷** There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.

**⁸** (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) 

**⁹** Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. 

**¹⁰** Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.

**¹¹** The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? 

**¹²** Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? 

**¹³** Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:

**¹⁴** But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.

**¹⁵** The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. 

**¹⁶** Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.

**¹⁷** The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:

**¹⁸** For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.

**¹⁹** The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. 

**²⁰** Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 

**²¹** Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.

**²²** Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.

**²³** But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.

**²⁴** God *is* a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship *him* in spirit and in truth.

**²⁵** The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. 

**²⁶** Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am *he.* 

**²⁷** ¶ And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? 

**²⁸** The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, 

**²⁹** Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? 

**³⁰** Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. 

**³¹** ¶ In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. 

**³²** But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. 

**³³** Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him *ought* to eat? 

**³⁴** Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.

**³⁵** Say not ye, There are yet four months, and *then* cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.

**³⁶** And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.

**³⁷** And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.

**³⁸** I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.

**³⁹** ¶ And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. 

**⁴⁰** So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. 

**⁴¹** And many more believed because of his own word; 

**⁴²** And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard *him* ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. 

**⁴³** ¶ Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. 

**⁴⁴** For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. 

**⁴⁵** Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilæans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. 

**⁴⁶** So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. 

**⁴⁷** When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judæa into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. 

**⁴⁸** Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.

**⁴⁹** The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. 

**⁵⁰** Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. 

**⁵¹** And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told *him*, saying, Thy son liveth. 

**⁵²** Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. 

**⁵³** So the father knew that *it was* at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house. 

**⁵⁴** This *is* again the second miracle *that* Jesus did, when he was come out of Judæa into Galilee.
