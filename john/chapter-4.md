# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, 

<sup>2</sup> (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) 

<sup>3</sup> He left Judæa, and departed again into Galilee. 

<sup>4</sup> And he must needs go through Samaria. 

<sup>5</sup> Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 

<sup>6</sup> Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour. 

<sup>7</sup> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. 

<sup>8</sup> (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) 

<sup>9</sup> Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. 

<sup>10</sup> Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. 

<sup>11</sup> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? 

<sup>12</sup> Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? 

<sup>13</sup> Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: 

<sup>14</sup> But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. 

<sup>15</sup> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. 

<sup>16</sup> Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. 

<sup>17</sup> The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: 

<sup>18</sup> For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. 

<sup>19</sup> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. 

<sup>20</sup> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 

<sup>21</sup> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. 

<sup>22</sup> Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. 

<sup>23</sup> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. 

<sup>24</sup> God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. 

<sup>25</sup> The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. 

<sup>26</sup> Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. 

<sup>27</sup> ¶ And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? 

<sup>28</sup> The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, 

<sup>29</sup> Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? 

<sup>30</sup> Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. 

<sup>31</sup> ¶ In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. 

<sup>32</sup> But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. 

<sup>33</sup> Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat? 

<sup>34</sup> Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. 

<sup>35</sup> Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. 

<sup>36</sup> And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. 

<sup>37</sup> And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. 

<sup>38</sup> I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. 

<sup>39</sup> ¶ And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. 

<sup>40</sup> So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. 

<sup>41</sup> And many more believed because of his own word; 

<sup>42</sup> And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. 

<sup>43</sup> ¶ Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. 

<sup>44</sup> For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. 

<sup>45</sup> Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilæans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. 

<sup>46</sup> So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. 

<sup>47</sup> When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judæa into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. 

<sup>48</sup> Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. 

<sup>49</sup> The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. 

<sup>50</sup> Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. 

<sup>51</sup> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth. 

<sup>52</sup> Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. 

<sup>53</sup> So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house. 

<sup>54</sup> This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judæa into Galilee.
