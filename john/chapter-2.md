# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: 

<sup>2</sup> And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. 

<sup>3</sup> And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. 

<sup>4</sup> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. 

<sup>5</sup> His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. 

<sup>6</sup> And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. 

<sup>7</sup> Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. 

<sup>8</sup> And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it. 

<sup>9</sup> When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, 

<sup>10</sup> And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now. 

<sup>11</sup> This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. 

<sup>12</sup> ¶ After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days. 

<sup>13</sup> ¶ And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, 

<sup>14</sup> And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: 

<sup>15</sup> And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables; 

<sup>16</sup> And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise. 

<sup>17</sup> And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. 

<sup>18</sup> ¶ Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? 

<sup>19</sup> Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. 

<sup>20</sup> Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? 

<sup>21</sup> But he spake of the temple of his body. 

<sup>22</sup> When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. 

<sup>23</sup> ¶ Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. 

<sup>24</sup> But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, 

<sup>25</sup> And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.
