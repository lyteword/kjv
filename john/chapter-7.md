# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him. 

<sup>2</sup> Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand. 

<sup>3</sup> His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judæa, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. 

<sup>4</sup> For *there is* no man *that* doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world. 

<sup>5</sup> For neither did his brethren believe in him. 

<sup>6</sup> Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.

<sup>7</sup> The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.

<sup>8</sup> Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.

<sup>9</sup> When he had said these words unto them, he abode *still* in Galilee. 

<sup>10</sup> ¶ But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. 

<sup>11</sup> Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? 

<sup>12</sup> And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people. 

<sup>13</sup> Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews. 

<sup>14</sup> ¶ Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. 

<sup>15</sup> And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? 

<sup>16</sup> Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.

<sup>17</sup> If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or *whether* I speak of myself.

<sup>18</sup> He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.

<sup>19</sup> Did not Moses give you the law, and *yet* none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?

<sup>20</sup> The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee? 

<sup>21</sup> Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.

<sup>22</sup> Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers ;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.

<sup>23</sup> If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?

<sup>24</sup> Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.

<sup>25</sup> Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill? 

<sup>26</sup> But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ? 

<sup>27</sup> Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. 

<sup>28</sup> Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.

<sup>29</sup> But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.

<sup>30</sup> Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. 

<sup>31</sup> And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this *man* hath done? 

<sup>32</sup> ¶ The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him. 

<sup>33</sup> Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and *then* I go unto him that sent me.

<sup>34</sup> Ye shall seek me, and shall not find *me*: and where I am, *thither* ye cannot come.

<sup>35</sup> Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? 

<sup>36</sup> What *manner of* saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find *me*: and where I am, *thither* ye cannot come? 

<sup>37</sup> In the last day, that great *day* of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.

<sup>38</sup> He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.

<sup>39</sup> (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet *given*; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.) 

<sup>40</sup> ¶ Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet. 

<sup>41</sup> Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee? 

<sup>42</sup> Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? 

<sup>43</sup> So there was a division among the people because of him. 

<sup>44</sup> And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him. 

<sup>45</sup> ¶ Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? 

<sup>46</sup> The officers answered, Never man spake like this man. 

<sup>47</sup> Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived? 

<sup>48</sup> Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? 

<sup>49</sup> But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed. 

<sup>50</sup> Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,) 

<sup>51</sup> Doth our law judge *any* man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth? 

<sup>52</sup> They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. 

<sup>53</sup> And every man went unto his own house.
