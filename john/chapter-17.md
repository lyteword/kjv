# Chapter 17

**¹** These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:

**²** As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.

**³** And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.

**⁴** I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.

**⁵** And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.

**⁶** I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.

**⁷** Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.

**⁸** For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received *them*, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.

**⁹** I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.

**¹⁰** And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.

**¹¹** And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we *are*.

**¹²** While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.

**¹³** And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.

**¹⁴** I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

**¹⁵** I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.

**¹⁶** They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

**¹⁷** Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.

**¹⁸** As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.

**¹⁹** And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.

**²⁰** Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;

**²¹** That they all may be one; as thou, Father, *art* in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.

**²²** And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:

**²³** I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.

**²⁴** Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.

**²⁵** O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.

**²⁶** And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare *it*: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.
