# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: 

<sup>2</sup> The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. 

<sup>3</sup> Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he can not see the kingdom of God.

<sup>4</sup> Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born? 

<sup>5</sup> Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and *of* the Spirit, he can not enter into the kingdom of God.

<sup>6</sup> That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

<sup>7</sup> Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.

<sup>8</sup> The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.

<sup>9</sup> Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? 

<sup>10</sup> Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?

<sup>11</sup> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.

<sup>12</sup> If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you *of* heavenly things?

<sup>13</sup> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, *even* the Son of man which is in heaven.

<sup>14</sup> ¶ And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:

<sup>15</sup> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.

<sup>16</sup> ¶ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

<sup>17</sup> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.

<sup>18</sup> ¶ He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

<sup>19</sup> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.

<sup>20</sup> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.

<sup>21</sup> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

<sup>22</sup> ¶ After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judæa; and there he tarried with them, and baptized. 

<sup>23</sup> ¶ And John also was baptizing in Ænon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized. 

<sup>24</sup> For John was not yet cast into prison. 

<sup>25</sup> ¶ Then there arose a question between *some* of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying. 

<sup>26</sup> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all *men* come to him. 

<sup>27</sup> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven. 

<sup>28</sup> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. 

<sup>29</sup> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled. 

<sup>30</sup> He must increase, but I *must* decrease. 

<sup>31</sup> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all. 

<sup>32</sup> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony. 

<sup>33</sup> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true. 

<sup>34</sup> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure *unto him*. 

<sup>35</sup> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. 

<sup>36</sup> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.
