# 1 Chronicles 11 

**¹** Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we *are* thy bone and thy flesh. 

**²** And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou *wast* he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel. 

**³** Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel. 

**⁴** ¶ And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which *is* Jebus; where the Jebusites *were*, the inhabitants of the land. 

**⁵** And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which *is* the city of David. 

**⁶** And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief. 

**⁷** And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David. 

**⁸** And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city. 

**⁹** So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts *was* with him. 

**¹⁰** ¶ These also *are* the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, *and* with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel. 

**¹¹** And this *is* the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain *by him* at one time. 

**¹²** And after him *was* Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who *was one* of the three mighties. 

**¹³** He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines. 

**¹⁴** And they set themselves in the midst of *that* parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved *them* by a great deliverance. 

**¹⁵** ¶ Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim. 

**¹⁶** And David *was* then in the hold, and the Philistines’ garrison *was* then at Beth-lehem. 

**¹⁷** And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth-lehem, that *is* at the gate! 

**¹⁸** And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that *was* by the gate, and took *it*, and brought *it* to David: but David would not drink *of* it, but poured it out to the LORD, 

**¹⁹** And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with *the jeopardy of* their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest. 

**²⁰** ¶ And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew *them*, and had a name among the three. 

**²¹** Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the *first* three. 

**²²** Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day. 

**²³** And he slew an Egyptian, a man of *great* stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian’s hand *was* a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear. 

**²⁴** These *things* did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties. 

**²⁵** Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the *first* three: and David set him over his guard. 

**²⁶** ¶ Also the valiant men of the armies *were*, Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem, 

**²⁷** Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,

**³²** Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, 

**³³** Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, 

**³⁴** The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite,
