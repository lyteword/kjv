<sup>23</sup> ¶ But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the LORD had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens. 

<sup>24</sup> Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David.

<sup>29</sup> And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai: 

<sup>30</sup> Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite: 

<sup>31</sup> And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite. All these were the rulers of the substance which was king David’s.

<sup>33</sup> And Ahithophel was the king’s counsellor: and Hushai the Archite was the king’s companion: 

<sup>34</sup> And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the general of the king’s army was Joab.
