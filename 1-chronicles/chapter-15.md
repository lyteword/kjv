# Chapter 15

**¹** And *David* made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent. 

**²** Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever. 

**³** And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it. 

**⁴** And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: 

**⁵** Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty: 

**⁶** Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty: 

**⁷** Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty: 

**⁸** Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred: 

**⁹** Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore: 

**¹⁰** Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve. 

**¹¹** And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, 

**¹²** And said unto them, Ye *are* the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, *both* ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto *the place that* I have prepared for it. 

**¹³** For because ye *did it* not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order. 

**¹⁴** So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel. 

**¹⁵** And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD. 

**¹⁶** And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren *to be* the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy. 

**¹⁷** So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 

**¹⁸** And with them their brethren of the second *degree*, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters. 

**¹⁹** So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, *were appointed* to sound with cymbals of brass; 

**²⁰** And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth; 

**²¹** And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel. 

**²²** And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, *was* for song: he instructed about the song, because he *was* skilful. 

**²³** And Berechiah and Elkanah *were* doorkeepers for the ark. 

**²⁴** And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah *were* doorkeepers for the ark. 

**²⁵** ¶ So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obed-edom with joy. 

**²⁶** And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams. 

**²⁷** And David *was* clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also *had* upon him an ephod of linen. 

**²⁸** Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps. 

**²⁹** ¶ And it came to pass, *as* the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.
