# 1 Chronicles 17 

**¹** Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD *remaineth* under curtains. 

**²** Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that *is* in thine heart; for God *is* with thee. 

**³** ¶ And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, 

**⁴** Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in: 

**⁵** For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from *one* tabernacle *to another*. 

**⁶** Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars? 

**⁷** Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, *even* from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel: 

**⁸** And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that *are* in the earth. 

**⁹** Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning, 

**¹⁰** And since the time that I commanded judges *to be* over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house. 

**¹¹** ¶ And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go *to be* with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. 

**¹²** He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever. 

**¹³** I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took *it* from *him* that was before thee: 

**¹⁴** But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore. 

**¹⁵** According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. 

**¹⁶** ¶ And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who *am* I, O LORD God, and what *is* mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? 

**¹⁷** And *yet* this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast *also* spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God. 

**¹⁸** What can David *speak* more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant. 

**¹⁹** O LORD, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all *these* great things. 

**²⁰** O LORD, *there is* none like thee, neither *is there any* God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 

**²¹** And what one nation in the earth *is* like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem *to be* his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt? 

**²²** For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God. 

**²³** Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said. 

**²⁴** Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts *is* the God of Israel, *even* a God to Israel: and *let* the house of David thy servant *be* established before thee. 

**²⁵** For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found *in his heart* to pray before thee. 

**²⁶** And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: 

**²⁷** Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and *it shall be* blessed for ever.
