# 1 Chronicles 16 

**¹** So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God. 

**²** And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD. 

**³** And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon *of wine*. 

**⁴** ¶ And he appointed *certain* of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel: 

**⁵** Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; 

**⁶** Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God. 

**⁷** ¶ Then on that day David delivered first *this psalm* to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren. 

**⁸** Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people. 

**⁹** Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works. 

**¹⁰** Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. 

**¹¹** Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually. 

**¹²** Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; 

**¹³** O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. 

**¹⁴** He *is* the LORD our God; his judgments *are* in all the earth. 

**¹⁵** Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word *which* he commanded to a thousand generations; 

**¹⁶** *Even of the covenant* which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac; 

**¹⁷** And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, *and* to Israel *for* an everlasting covenant, 

**¹⁸** Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance; 

**¹⁹** When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it. 

**²⁰** And *when* they went from nation to nation, and from *one* kingdom to another people; 

**²¹** He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes, 

**²²** *Saying*, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. 

**²³** Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation. 

**²⁴** Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations. 

**²⁵** For great *is* the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also *is* to be feared above all gods. 

**²⁶** For all the gods of the people *are* idols: but the LORD made the heavens. 

**²⁷** Glory and honour *are* in his presence; strength and gladness *are* in his place. 

**²⁸** Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 

**²⁹** Give unto the LORD the glory *due* unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. 

**³⁰** Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved. 

**³¹** Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let *men* say among the nations, The LORD reigneth. 

**³²** Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that *is* therein. 

**³³** Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth. 

**³⁴** O give thanks unto the LORD; for *he is* good; for his mercy *endureth* for ever. 

**³⁵** And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, *and* glory in thy praise. 

**³⁶** Blessed *be* the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD. 

**³⁷** ¶ So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required: 

**³⁸** And Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah *to be* porters: 

**³⁹** And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that *was* at Gibeon, 

**⁴⁰** To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and *to do* according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel; 

**⁴¹** And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy *endureth* for ever; 

**⁴²** And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun *were* porters. 

**⁴³** And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.
