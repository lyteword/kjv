<sup>10</sup> And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep *me* from evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested.

<sup>22</sup> And Jokim, and the men of Chozeba, and Joash, and Saraph, who had the dominion in Moab, and Jashubi-lehem. And *these are* ancient things. 

<sup>23</sup> These *were* the potters, and those that dwelt among plants and hedges: there they dwelt with the king for his work. 

<sup>24</sup> ¶ The sons of Simeon *were*, Nemuel, and Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, *and* Shaul: 

<sup>25</sup> Shallum his son, Mibsam his son, Mishma his son. 

<sup>26</sup> And the sons of Mishma; Hamuel his son, Zacchur his son, Shimei his son. 

<sup>27</sup> And Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters; but his brethren had not many children, neither did all their family multiply, like to the children of Judah. 

<sup>28</sup> And they dwelt at Beer-sheba, and Moladah, and Hazar-shual, 

<sup>29</sup> And at Bilhah, and at Ezem, and at Tolad, 

<sup>30</sup> And at Bethuel, and at Hormah, and at Ziklag, 

<sup>31</sup> And at Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-susim, and at Beth-birei, and at Shaaraim. These *were* their cities unto the reign of David. 

<sup>32</sup> And their villages *were*, Etam, and Ain, Rimmon, and Tochen, and Ashan, five cities: 

<sup>33</sup> And all their villages that *were* round about the same cities, unto Baal. These *were* their habitations, and their genealogy. 

<sup>34</sup> And Meshobab, and Jamlech, and Joshah the son of Amaziah,

<sup>37</sup> And Ziza the son of Shiphi, the son of Allon, the son of Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah; 

<sup>38</sup> These mentioned by *their* names *were* princes in their families: and the house of their fathers increased greatly. 

<sup>39</sup> ¶ And they went to the entrance of Gedor, *even* unto the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks. 

<sup>40</sup> And they found fat pasture and good, and the land *was* wide, and quiet, and peaceable; for *they* of Ham had dwelt there of old. 

<sup>41</sup> And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were found there, and destroyed them utterly unto this day, and dwelt in their rooms: because *there was* pasture there for their flocks. 

<sup>42</sup> And *some* of them, *even* of the sons of Simeon, five hundred men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi. 

<sup>43</sup> And they smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped, and dwelt there unto this day.
