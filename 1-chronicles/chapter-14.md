# 1 Chronicles 14 

**¹** Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house. 

**²** And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel. 

**³** ¶ And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters. 

**⁴** Now these *are* the names of *his* children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, 

**⁵** And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet, 

**⁶** And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 

**⁷** And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet. 

**⁸** ¶ And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard *of it*, and went out against them. 

**⁹** And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 

**¹⁰** And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand. 

**¹¹** So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim. 

**¹²** And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire. 

**¹³** And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley. 

**¹⁴** Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. 

**¹⁵** And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, *that* then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. 

**¹⁶** David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer. 

**¹⁷** And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.
