**⁴** And Abishua, and Naaman, and Ahoah, 

**⁵** And Gera, and Shephuphan, and Huram. 

**⁶** And these *are* the sons of Ehud: these are the heads of the fathers of the inhabitants of Geba, and they removed them to Manahath:

**¹⁰** And Jeuz, and Shachia, and Mirma. These *were* his sons, heads of the fathers. 

**¹¹** And of Hushim he begat Abitub, and Elpaal. 

**¹²** The sons of Elpaal; Eber, and Misham, and Shamed, who built Ono, and Lod, with the towns thereof:

**²⁸** These *were* heads of the fathers, by their generations, chief *men*. These dwelt in Jerusalem.

**³⁶** And Ahaz begat Jehoadah; and Jehoadah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza, 

**³⁷** And Moza begat Binea: Rapha *was* his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son: 

**³⁸** And Azel had six sons, whose names *are* these, Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan. All these *were* the sons of Azel.
