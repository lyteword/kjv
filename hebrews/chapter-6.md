# Hebrews 6 

**¹** Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, 

**²** Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. 

**³** And this will we do, if God permit. 

**⁴** For *it is* impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, 

**⁵** And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, 

**⁶** If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put *him* to an open shame. 

**⁷** For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God: 

**⁸** But that which beareth thorns and briers *is* rejected, and *is* nigh unto cursing; whose end *is* to be burned. 

**⁹** But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak. 

**¹⁰** For God *is* not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister. 

**¹¹** And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end: 

**¹²** That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. 

**¹³** For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself, 

**¹⁴** Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. 

**¹⁵** And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. 

**¹⁶** For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation *is* to them an end of all strife. 

**¹⁷** Where in God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed *it* by an oath: 

**¹⁸** That by two immutable things, in which *it was* impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us: 

**¹⁹** Which *hope* we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; 

**²⁰** Whither the forerunner is for us entered, *even* Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
