# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him; 

<sup>2</sup> To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace; 

<sup>3</sup> Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually. 

<sup>4</sup> Now consider how great this man *was*, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. 

<sup>5</sup> And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: 

<sup>6</sup> But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises. 

<sup>7</sup> And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better. 

<sup>8</sup> And here men that die receive tithes; but there he *receiveth them*, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth. 

<sup>9</sup> And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham. 

<sup>10</sup> For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him. 

<sup>11</sup> If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need *was there* that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron? 

<sup>12</sup> For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law. 

<sup>13</sup> For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar. 

<sup>14</sup> For *it is* evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood. 

<sup>15</sup> And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest, 

<sup>16</sup> Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life. 

<sup>17</sup> For he testifieth, Thou *art* a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. 

<sup>18</sup> For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. 

<sup>19</sup> For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope *did*; by the which we draw nigh unto God. 

<sup>20</sup> And in asmuch as not without an oath *he was made priest*: 

<sup>21</sup> (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou *art* a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:) 

<sup>22</sup> By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament. 

<sup>23</sup> And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death: 

<sup>24</sup> But this *man*, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. 

<sup>25</sup> Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. 

<sup>26</sup> For such an high priest became us, *who is* holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; 

<sup>27</sup> Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself. 

<sup>28</sup> For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, *maketh* the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.
