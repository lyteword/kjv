# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left *us* of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. 

<sup>2</sup> For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard *it*. 

<sup>3</sup> For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. 

<sup>4</sup> For he spake in a certain place of the seventh *day* on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works. 

<sup>5</sup> And in this *place* again, If they shall enter into my rest. 

<sup>6</sup> Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter there in, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief: 

<sup>7</sup> Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. 

<sup>8</sup> For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day. 

<sup>9</sup> There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. 

<sup>10</sup> For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God *did* from his. 

<sup>11</sup> Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief. 

<sup>12</sup> For the word of God *is* quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and *is* a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. 

<sup>13</sup> Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things *are* naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. 

<sup>14</sup> Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast *our* profession. 

<sup>15</sup> For we have not an high priest which can not be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as *we are, yet* without sin. 

<sup>16</sup> Let us therefore come bold ly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
