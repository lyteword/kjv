# Hebrews 11 

**¹** Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. 

**²** For by it the elders obtained a good report. 

**³** Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. 

**⁴** By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh. 

**⁵** By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. 

**⁶** But without faith *it is* impossible to please *him*: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and *that* he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. 

**⁷** By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. 

**⁸** By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. 

**⁹** By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as *in* a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: 

**¹⁰** For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker *is* God. 

**¹¹** Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised. 

**¹²** Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, *so many* as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable. 

**¹³** These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of *them*, and embraced *them*, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. 

**¹⁴** For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. 

**¹⁵** And truly, if they had been mindful of that *country* from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. 

**¹⁶** But now they desire a better *country*, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city. 

**¹⁷** By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten *son*, 

**¹⁸** Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called: 

**¹⁹** Accounting that God *was* able to raise *him* up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure. 

**²⁰** By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. 

**²¹** By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, *leaning* upon the top of his staff. 

**²²** By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones. 

**²³** By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw *he was* a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment. 

**²⁴** By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter; 

**²⁵** Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; 

**²⁶** Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward. 

**²⁷** By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. 

**²⁸** Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them. 

**²⁹** By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry *land*: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned. 

**³⁰** By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days. 

**³¹** By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace. 

**³²** And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and *of* Barak, and *of* Samson, and *of* Jephthae; *of* David also, and Samuel, and *of* the prophets: 

**³³** Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, 

**³⁴** Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. 

**³⁵** Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection: 

**³⁶** And others had trial of *cruel* mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: 

**³⁷** They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goat skins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; 

**³⁸** (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and *in* mountains, and *in* dens and caves of the earth. 

**³⁹** And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: 

**⁴⁰** God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.
