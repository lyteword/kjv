# Hebrews 3 

**¹** Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus; 

**²** Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses *was faithful* in all his house. 

**³** For this *man* was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, in asmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house. 

**⁴** For every house is builded by some *man*; but he that built all things *is* God. 

**⁵** And Moses verily *was* faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; 

**⁶** But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. 

**⁷** Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice, 

**⁸** Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness: 

**⁹** When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years. 

**¹⁰** Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in *their* heart; and they have not known my ways. 

**¹¹** So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.) 

**¹²** Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. 

**¹³** But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. 

**¹⁴** For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end; 

**¹⁵** While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation. 

**¹⁶** For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses. 

**¹⁷** But with whom was he grieved forty years? *was it* not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness? 

**¹⁸** And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not? 

**¹⁹** So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
