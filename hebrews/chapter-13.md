# Hebrews 13 

**¹** Let brotherly love continue. 

**²** Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for there by some have entertained angels unawares. 

**³** Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; *and* them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body. 

**⁴** Marriage *is* honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. 

**⁵** *Let your* conversation *be* without covetousness; *and be* content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. 

**⁶** So that we may boldly say, The Lord *is* my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. 

**⁷** Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of *their* conversation. 

**⁸** Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever. 

**⁹** Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For *it is* a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein. 

**¹⁰** We have an altar, where of they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle. 

**¹¹** For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp. 

**¹²** Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate. 

**¹³** Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. 

**¹⁴** For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. 

**¹⁵** By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of *our* lips giving thanks to his name. 

**¹⁶** But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. 

**¹⁷** Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that *is* unprofitable for you. 

**¹⁸** Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly. 

**¹⁹** But I beseech *you* the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner. 

**²⁰** Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, 

**²¹** Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom *be* glory for ever and ever. Amen. 

**²²** And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words. 

**²³** Know ye that *our* brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you. 

**²⁴** Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you. 

**²⁵** Grace *be* with you all. Amen.
