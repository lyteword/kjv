# Chapter 13

<sup>1</sup> Let brotherly love continue. 

<sup>2</sup> Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. 

<sup>3</sup> Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body. 

<sup>4</sup> Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. 

<sup>5</sup> Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. 

<sup>6</sup> So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. 

<sup>7</sup> Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation. 

<sup>8</sup> Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever. 

<sup>9</sup> Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein. 

<sup>10</sup> We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle. 

<sup>11</sup> For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp. 

<sup>12</sup> Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate. 

<sup>13</sup> Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. 

<sup>14</sup> For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. 

<sup>15</sup> By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name. 

<sup>16</sup> But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. 

<sup>17</sup> Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you. 

<sup>18</sup> Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly. 

<sup>19</sup> But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner. 

<sup>20</sup> Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, 

<sup>21</sup> Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 

<sup>22</sup> And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words. 

<sup>23</sup> Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you. 

<sup>24</sup> Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you. 

<sup>25</sup> Grace be with you all. Amen.
