# Chapter 18

<sup>1</sup> After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; 

<sup>2</sup> And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them. 

<sup>3</sup> And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers. 

<sup>4</sup> And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks. 

<sup>5</sup> And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews *that* Jesus *was* Christ. 

<sup>6</sup> And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook *his* raiment, and said unto them, Your blood *be* upon your own heads; I *am* clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. 

<sup>7</sup> ¶ And he departed thence, and entered into a certain *man’s* house, named Justus, *one* that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. 

<sup>8</sup> And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. 

<sup>9</sup> Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid , but speak , and hold not thy peace : 

<sup>10</sup> For I am with thee , and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee : for I have much people in this city . 

<sup>11</sup> And he continued *there* a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. 

<sup>12</sup> ¶ And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat, 

<sup>13</sup> Saying, This *fellow* persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law. 

<sup>14</sup> And when Paul was now about to open *his* mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O *ye* Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: 

<sup>15</sup> But if it be a question of words and names, and *of* your law, look ye *to it*; for I will be no judge of such *matters*. 

<sup>16</sup> And he drave them from the judgment seat. 

<sup>17</sup> Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat *him* before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things. 

<sup>18</sup> ¶ And Paul *after this* tarried *there* yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn *his* head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow. 

<sup>19</sup> And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. 

<sup>20</sup> When they desired *him* to tarry longer time with them, he consented not; 

<sup>21</sup> But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus. 

<sup>22</sup> And when he had landed at Cæsarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch. 

<sup>23</sup> And after he had spent some time *there*, he departed, and went over *all* the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples. 

<sup>24</sup> ¶ And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, *and* mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. 

<sup>25</sup> This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. 

<sup>26</sup> And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto *them*, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly. 

<sup>27</sup> And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace: 

<sup>28</sup> For he mightily convinced the Jews, *and that* publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.
