# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. 

<sup>2</sup> Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables. 

<sup>3</sup> Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. 

<sup>4</sup> But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word. 

<sup>5</sup> ¶ And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: 

<sup>6</sup> Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them. 

<sup>7</sup> And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. 

<sup>8</sup> And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people. 

<sup>9</sup> ¶ Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen. 

<sup>10</sup> And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake. 

<sup>11</sup> Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God. 

<sup>12</sup> And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council, 

<sup>13</sup> And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law: 

<sup>14</sup> For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us. 

<sup>15</sup> And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.
