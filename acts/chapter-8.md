# Acts 8 

**¹** And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judæa and Samaria, except the apostles. 

**²** And devout men carried Stephen *to his burial*, and made great lamentation over him. 

**³** As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed *them* to prison. 

**⁴** Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word. 

**⁵** Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them. 

**⁶** And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. 

**⁷** For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed *with them*: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed. 

**⁸** And there was great joy in that city. 

**⁹** But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: 

**¹⁰** To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. 

**¹¹** And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. 

**¹²** But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 

**¹³** Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done. 

**¹⁴** Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: 

**¹⁵** Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: 

**¹⁶** (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) 

**¹⁷** Then laid they *their* hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. 

**¹⁸** And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, 

**¹⁹** Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. 

**²⁰** But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. 

**²¹** Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God. 

**²²** Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. 

**²³** For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and *in* the bond of iniquity. 

**²⁴** Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me. 

**²⁵** And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans. 

**²⁶** And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. 

**²⁷** And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship, 

**²⁸** Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet. 

**²⁹** Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. 

**³⁰** And Philip ran thither to *him*, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? 

**³¹** And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. 

**³²** The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth: 

**³³** In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth. 

**³⁴** And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man? 

**³⁵** Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. 

**³⁶** And as they went on *their* way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, *here is* water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? 

**³⁷** And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. 

**³⁸** And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. 

**³⁹** And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing. 

**⁴⁰** But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Cæsarea.
