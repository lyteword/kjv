# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, 

<sup>2</sup> Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead. 

<sup>3</sup> And they laid hands on them, and put *them* in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide. 

<sup>4</sup> Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand. 

<sup>5</sup> ¶ And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes, 

<sup>6</sup> And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem. 

<sup>7</sup> And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this? 

<sup>8</sup> Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, 

<sup>9</sup> If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole; 

<sup>10</sup> Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, *even* by him doth this man stand here before you whole. 

<sup>11</sup> This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. 

<sup>12</sup> Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. 

<sup>13</sup> ¶ Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. 

<sup>14</sup> And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it. 

<sup>15</sup> But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, 

<sup>16</sup> Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them *is* manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we can not deny *it*. 

<sup>17</sup> But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. 

<sup>18</sup> And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. 

<sup>19</sup> But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. 

<sup>20</sup> For we can not but speak the things which we have seen and heard. 

<sup>21</sup> So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all *men* glorified God for that which was done. 

<sup>22</sup> For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed. 

<sup>23</sup> ¶ And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them. 

<sup>24</sup> And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou *art* God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is: 

<sup>25</sup> Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? 

<sup>26</sup> The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ. 

<sup>27</sup> For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together, 

<sup>28</sup> For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done. 

<sup>29</sup> And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word, 

<sup>30</sup> By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus. 

<sup>31</sup> ¶ And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness. 

<sup>32</sup> And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any *of them* that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. 

<sup>33</sup> And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all. 

<sup>34</sup> Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, 

<sup>35</sup> And laid *them* down at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need. 

<sup>36</sup> And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, ( which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, *and* of the country of Cyprus, 

<sup>37</sup> Having land, sold *it*, and brought the money, and laid *it* at the apostles’ feet.
