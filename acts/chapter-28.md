# Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita. 

<sup>2</sup> And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold. 

<sup>3</sup> And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand. 

<sup>4</sup> And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live. 

<sup>5</sup> And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm. 

<sup>6</sup> Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god. 

<sup>7</sup> In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously. 

<sup>8</sup> And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him. 

<sup>9</sup> So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed: 

<sup>10</sup> Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary. 

<sup>11</sup> And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux. 

<sup>12</sup> And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days. 

<sup>13</sup> And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli: 

<sup>14</sup> Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome. 

<sup>15</sup> And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage. 

<sup>16</sup> And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him. 

<sup>17</sup> And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. 

<sup>18</sup> Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me. 

<sup>19</sup> But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Cæsar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of. 

<sup>20</sup> For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain. 

<sup>21</sup> And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judæa concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee. 

<sup>22</sup> But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against. 

<sup>23</sup> And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening. 

<sup>24</sup> And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not. 

<sup>25</sup> And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers, 

<sup>26</sup> Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive: 

<sup>27</sup> For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. 

<sup>28</sup> Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it. 

<sup>29</sup> And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves. 

<sup>30</sup> And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him, 

<sup>31</sup> Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.
