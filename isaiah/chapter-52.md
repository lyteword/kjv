# Chapter 52

<sup>1</sup> Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean. 

<sup>2</sup> Shake thyself from the dust; arise, *and* sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion. 

<sup>3</sup> For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money. 

<sup>4</sup> For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause. 

<sup>5</sup> Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day *is* blasphemed. 

<sup>6</sup> Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore *they shall know* in that day that I *am* he that doth speak: behold, *it is* I. 

<sup>7</sup> ¶ How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth! 

<sup>8</sup> Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion. 

<sup>9</sup> ¶ Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem. 

<sup>10</sup> The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God. 

<sup>11</sup> ¶ Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean *thing;* go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD. 

<sup>12</sup> For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel *will be* your rereward. 

<sup>13</sup> ¶ Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high. 

<sup>14</sup> As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men: 

<sup>15</sup> So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for *that* which had not been told them shall they see; and *that* which they had not heard shall they consider.
