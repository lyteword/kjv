# Isaiah 3 

**¹** For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water, 

**²** The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient, 

**³** The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator. 

**⁴** And I will give children *to be* their princes, and babes shall rule over them. 

**⁵** And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable. 

**⁶** When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, *saying*, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and *let* this ruin *be* under thy hand: 

**⁷** In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house *is* neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people. 

**⁸** For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings *are* against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory. 

**⁹** ¶ The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide *it* not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves. 

**¹⁰** Say ye to the righteous, that *it shall be* well *with him:* for they shall eat the fruit of their doings. 

**¹¹** Woe unto the wicked! *it shall be* ill *with him:* for the reward of his hands shall be given him. 

**¹²** ¶ *As for* my people, children *are* their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause *thee* to err, and destroy the way of thy paths. 

**¹³** The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people. 

**¹⁴** The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor *is* in your houses. 

**¹⁵** What mean ye *that* ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts. 

**¹⁶** ¶ Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing *as* they go, and making a tinkling with their feet: 

**¹⁷** Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts. 

**¹⁸** In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of *their* tinkling ornaments *about their feet*, and *their* cauls, and *their* round tires like the moon, 

**¹⁹** The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, 

**²⁰** The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings, 

**²¹** The rings, and nose jewels, 

**²²** The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins, 

**²³** The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails. 

**²⁴** And it shall come to pass, *that* instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; *and* burning instead of beauty. 

**²⁵** Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war. 

**²⁶** And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she *being* desolate shall sit upon the ground.
