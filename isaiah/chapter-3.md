# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water, 

<sup>2</sup> The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient, 

<sup>3</sup> The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator. 

<sup>4</sup> And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them. 

<sup>5</sup> And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable. 

<sup>6</sup> When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand: 

<sup>7</sup> In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people. 

<sup>8</sup> For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory. 

<sup>9</sup> ¶ The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves. 

<sup>10</sup> Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings. 

<sup>11</sup> Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him. 

<sup>12</sup> ¶ As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths. 

<sup>13</sup> The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people. 

<sup>14</sup> The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses. 

<sup>15</sup> What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts. 

<sup>16</sup> ¶ Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet: 

<sup>17</sup> Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts. 

<sup>18</sup> In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon, 

<sup>19</sup> The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, 

<sup>20</sup> The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings, 

<sup>21</sup> The rings, and nose jewels, 

<sup>22</sup> The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins, 

<sup>23</sup> The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails. 

<sup>24</sup> And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty. 

<sup>25</sup> Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war. 

<sup>26</sup> And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground.
