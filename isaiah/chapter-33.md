# Isaiah 33 

**¹** Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou *wast* not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; *and* when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee. 

**²** O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble. 

**³** At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered. 

**⁴** And your spoil shall be gathered *like* the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them. 

**⁵** The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness. 

**⁶** And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, *and* strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD *is* his treasure. 

**⁷** Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly. 

**⁸** The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man. 

**⁹** The earth mourneth *and* languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed *and* hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off *their fruits*. 

**¹⁰** Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself. 

**¹¹** Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, *as* fire, shall devour you. 

**¹²** And the people shall be *as* the burnings of lime: *as* thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire. 

**¹³** ¶ Hear, ye *that are* far off, what I have done; and, ye *that are* near, acknowledge my might. 

**¹⁴** The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings? 

**¹⁵** He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; 

**¹⁶** He shall dwell on high: his place of defence *shall be* the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters *shall be* sure. 

**¹⁷** Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off. 

**¹⁸** Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where *is* the scribe? where *is* the receiver? where *is* he that counted the towers? 

**¹⁹** Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, *that thou canst* not understand. 

**²⁰** Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle *that* shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken. 

**²¹** But there the glorious LORD *will be* unto us a place of broad rivers *and* streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby. 

**²²** For the LORD *is* our judge, the LORD *is* our lawgiver, the LORD *is* our king; he will save us. 

**²³** Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey. 

**²⁴** And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein *shall be* forgiven *their* iniquity.
