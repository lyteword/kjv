# Chapter 40

<sup>1</sup> Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. 

<sup>2</sup> Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the LORD’s hand double for all her sins. 

<sup>3</sup> ¶ The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. 

<sup>4</sup> Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: 

<sup>5</sup> And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see *it* together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken *it*. 

<sup>6</sup> The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh *is* grass, and all the goodliness thereof *is* as the flower of the field: 

<sup>7</sup> The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people *is* grass. 

<sup>8</sup> The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever. 

<sup>9</sup> ¶ O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift *it* up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God! 

<sup>10</sup> Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong *hand*, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward *is* with him, and his work before him. 

<sup>11</sup> He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry *them* in his bosom, *and* shall gently lead those that are with young. 

<sup>12</sup> ¶ Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance? 

<sup>13</sup> Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or *being* his counsellor hath taught him? 

<sup>14</sup> With whom took he counsel, and *who* instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding? 

<sup>15</sup> Behold, the nations *are* as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing. 

<sup>16</sup> And Lebanon *is* not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering. 

<sup>17</sup> All nations before him *are* as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity. 

<sup>18</sup> ¶ To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him? 

<sup>19</sup> The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains. 

<sup>20</sup> He that *is* so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree *that* will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, *that* shall not be moved. 

<sup>21</sup> Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth? 

<sup>22</sup> *It is* he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof *are* as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in: 

<sup>23</sup> That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity. 

<sup>24</sup> Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble. 

<sup>25</sup> To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. 

<sup>26</sup> Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these *things*, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that *he is* strong in power; not one faileth. 

<sup>27</sup> Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God? 

<sup>28</sup> ¶ Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, *that* the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? *there is* no searching of his understanding. 

<sup>29</sup> He giveth power to the faint; and to *them that have* no might he increaseth strength. 

<sup>30</sup> Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: 

<sup>31</sup> But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew *their* strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; *and* they shall walk, and not faint.
