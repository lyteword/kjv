# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me. 

<sup>2</sup> Behold, God *is* my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH *is* my strength and *my* song; he also is become my salvation. 

<sup>3</sup> Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. 

<sup>4</sup> And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted. 

<sup>5</sup> Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this *is* known in all the earth. 

<sup>6</sup> Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great *is* the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
