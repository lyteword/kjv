# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said, 

<sup>2</sup> I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? 

<sup>3</sup> If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand. 

<sup>4</sup> He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered? 

<sup>5</sup> Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger. 

<sup>6</sup> Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble. 

<sup>7</sup> Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars. 

<sup>8</sup> Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. 

<sup>9</sup> Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. 

<sup>10</sup> Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number. 

<sup>11</sup> Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not. 

<sup>12</sup> Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou? 

<sup>13</sup> If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him. 

<sup>14</sup> How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him? 

<sup>15</sup> Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge. 

<sup>16</sup> If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. 

<sup>17</sup> For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause. 

<sup>18</sup> He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness. 

<sup>19</sup> If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead? 

<sup>20</sup> If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. 

<sup>21</sup> Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life. 

<sup>22</sup> This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. 

<sup>23</sup> If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent. 

<sup>24</sup> The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he? 

<sup>25</sup> Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good. 

<sup>26</sup> They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey. 

<sup>27</sup> If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself: 

<sup>28</sup> I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. 

<sup>29</sup> If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain? 

<sup>30</sup> If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean; 

<sup>31</sup> Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me. 

<sup>32</sup> For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment. 

<sup>33</sup> Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both. 

<sup>34</sup> Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me: 

<sup>35</sup> Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.
