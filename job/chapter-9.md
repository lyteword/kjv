# Job 9 

**¹** Then Job answered and said, 

**²** I know *it is* so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? 

**³** If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand. 

**⁴** *He is* wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened *himself* against him, and hath prospered? 

**⁵** Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger. 

**⁶** Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble. 

**⁷** Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars. 

**⁸** Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. 

**⁹** Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. 

**¹⁰** Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number. 

**¹¹** Lo, he goeth by me, and I see *him* not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not. 

**¹²** Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou? 

**¹³** *If* God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him. 

**¹⁴** How much less shall I answer him, *and* choose out my words *to reason* with him? 

**¹⁵** Whom, though I were righteous, *yet* would I not answer, *but* I would make supplication to my judge. 

**¹⁶** If I had called, and he had answered me; *yet* would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. 

**¹⁷** For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause. 

**¹⁸** He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness. 

**¹⁹** If *I speak* of strength, lo, *he is* strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time *to plead*? 

**²⁰** If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: *if I say*, I *am* perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. 

**²¹** *Though* I *were* perfect, *yet* would I not know my soul: I would despise my life. 

**²²** This *is* one *thing*, therefore I said *it*, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. 

**²³** If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent. 

**²⁴** The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, *and* who *is* he? 

**²⁵** Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good. 

**²⁶** They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle *that* hasteth to the prey. 

**²⁷** If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort *myself:* 

**²⁸** I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. 

**²⁹** *If* I be wicked, why then labour I in vain? 

**³⁰** If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean; 

**³¹** Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me. 

**³²** For *he is* not a man, as I *am, that* I should answer him, *and* we should come together in judgment. 

**³³** Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, *that* might lay his hand upon us both. 

**³⁴** Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me: 

**³⁵** *Then* would I speak, and not fear him; but *it is* not so with me.
