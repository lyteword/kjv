# Job 17 

**¹** My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves *are ready* for me. 

**²** *Are there* not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation? 

**³** Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who *is* he *that* will strike hands with me? 

**⁴** For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt *them*. 

**⁵** He that speaketh flattery to *his* friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail. 

**⁶** He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret. 

**⁷** Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members *are* as a shadow. 

**⁸** Upright *men* shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite. 

**⁹** The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger. 

**¹⁰** But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find *one* wise *man* among you. 

**¹¹** My days are past, my purposes are broken off, *even* the thoughts of my heart. 

**¹²** They change the night into day: the light *is* short because of darkness. 

**¹³** If I wait, the grave *is* mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness. 

**¹⁴** I have said to corruption, Thou *art* my father: to the worm, *Thou art* my mother, and my sister. 

**¹⁵** And where *is* now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it? 

**¹⁶** They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when *our* rest together *is* in the dust.
