# Chapter 17

<sup>1</sup> My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me. 

<sup>2</sup> Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation? 

<sup>3</sup> Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me? 

<sup>4</sup> For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them. 

<sup>5</sup> He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail. 

<sup>6</sup> He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret. 

<sup>7</sup> Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow. 

<sup>8</sup> Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite. 

<sup>9</sup> The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger. 

<sup>10</sup> But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you. 

<sup>11</sup> My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart. 

<sup>12</sup> They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness. 

<sup>13</sup> If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness. 

<sup>14</sup> I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister. 

<sup>15</sup> And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it? 

<sup>16</sup> They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.
