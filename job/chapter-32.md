# Chapter 32

<sup>1</sup> So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he *was* righteous in his own eyes. 

<sup>2</sup> Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. 

<sup>3</sup> Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and *yet* had condemned Job. 

<sup>4</sup> Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they *were* elder than he. 

<sup>5</sup> When Elihu saw that *there was* no answer in the mouth of *these* three men, then his wrath was kindled. 

<sup>6</sup> And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I *am* young, and ye *are* very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion. 

<sup>7</sup> I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom. 

<sup>8</sup> But *there is* a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. 

<sup>9</sup> Great men are not *always* wise: neither do the aged understand judgment. 

<sup>10</sup> Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion. 

<sup>11</sup> Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say. 

<sup>12</sup> Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, *there was* none of you that convinced Job, *or* that answered his words: 

<sup>13</sup> Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man. 

<sup>14</sup> Now he hath not directed *his* words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches. 

<sup>15</sup> They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking. 

<sup>16</sup> When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, *and* answered no more;) 

<sup>17</sup> *I said*, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion. 

<sup>18</sup> For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me. 

<sup>19</sup> Behold, my belly *is* as wine *which* hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles. 

<sup>20</sup> I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer. 

<sup>21</sup> Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man. 

<sup>22</sup> For I know not to give flattering titles; *in so doing* my maker would soon take me away.
