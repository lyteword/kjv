# Chapter 32

<sup>1</sup> So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 

<sup>2</sup> Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. 

<sup>3</sup> Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. 

<sup>4</sup> Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he. 

<sup>5</sup> When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled. 

<sup>6</sup> And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion. 

<sup>7</sup> I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom. 

<sup>8</sup> But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. 

<sup>9</sup> Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment. 

<sup>10</sup> Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion. 

<sup>11</sup> Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say. 

<sup>12</sup> Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words: 

<sup>13</sup> Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man. 

<sup>14</sup> Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches. 

<sup>15</sup> They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking. 

<sup>16</sup> When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;) 

<sup>17</sup> I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion. 

<sup>18</sup> For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me. 

<sup>19</sup> Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles. 

<sup>20</sup> I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer. 

<sup>21</sup> Let me not, I pray you, accept any manâ€™s person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man. 

<sup>22</sup> For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.
