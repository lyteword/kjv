# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> And Job answered and said, 

<sup>2</sup> No doubt but ye *are* the people, and wisdom shall die with you. 

<sup>3</sup> But I have understanding as well as you; I *am* not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these? 

<sup>4</sup> I am *as* one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright *man is* laughed to scorn. 

<sup>5</sup> He that is ready to slip with *his* feet *is as* a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease. 

<sup>6</sup> The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth *abundantly*. 

<sup>7</sup> But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee: 

<sup>8</sup> Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. 

<sup>9</sup> Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this? 

<sup>10</sup> In whose hand *is* the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind. 

<sup>11</sup> Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat? 

<sup>12</sup> With the ancient *is* wisdom; and in length of days understanding. 

<sup>13</sup> With him *is* wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding. 

<sup>14</sup> Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening. 

<sup>15</sup> Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth. 

<sup>16</sup> With him *is* strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver *are* his. 

<sup>17</sup> He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools. 

<sup>18</sup> He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle. 

<sup>19</sup> He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty. 

<sup>20</sup> He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged. 

<sup>21</sup> He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty. 

<sup>22</sup> He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death. 

<sup>23</sup> He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them *again*. 

<sup>24</sup> He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness *where there is* no way. 

<sup>25</sup> They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like *a* drunken *man*.
