# Chapter 13

<sup>1</sup> Lo, mine eye hath seen all *this*, mine ear hath heard and understood it. 

<sup>2</sup> What ye know, *the same* do I know also: I *am* not inferior unto you. 

<sup>3</sup> Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God. 

<sup>4</sup> But ye *are* forgers of lies, ye *are* all physicians of no value. 

<sup>5</sup> O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom. 

<sup>6</sup> Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips. 

<sup>7</sup> Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him? 

<sup>8</sup> Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God? 

<sup>9</sup> Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye *so* mock him? 

<sup>10</sup> He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons. 

<sup>11</sup> Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you? 

<sup>12</sup> Your remembrances *are* like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay. 

<sup>13</sup> Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what *will*. 

<sup>14</sup> Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand? 

<sup>15</sup> Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him. 

<sup>16</sup> He also *shall be* my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him. 

<sup>17</sup> Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears. 

<sup>18</sup> Behold now, I have ordered *my* cause; I know that I shall be justified. 

<sup>19</sup> Who *is* he *that* will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost. 

<sup>20</sup> Only do not two *things* unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee. 

<sup>21</sup> Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid. 

<sup>22</sup> Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me. 

<sup>23</sup> How many *are* mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin. 

<sup>24</sup> Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy? 

<sup>25</sup> Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble? 

<sup>26</sup> For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth. 

<sup>27</sup> Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet. 

<sup>28</sup> And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.
