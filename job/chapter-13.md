# Job 13 

**¹** Lo, mine eye hath seen all *this*, mine ear hath heard and understood it. 

**²** What ye know, *the same* do I know also: I *am* not inferior unto you. 

**³** Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God. 

**⁴** But ye *are* forgers of lies, ye *are* all physicians of no value. 

**⁵** O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom. 

**⁶** Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips. 

**⁷** Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him? 

**⁸** Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God? 

**⁹** Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye *so* mock him? 

**¹⁰** He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons. 

**¹¹** Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you? 

**¹²** Your remembrances *are* like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay. 

**¹³** Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what *will*. 

**¹⁴** Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand? 

**¹⁵** Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him. 

**¹⁶** He also *shall be* my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him. 

**¹⁷** Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears. 

**¹⁸** Behold now, I have ordered *my* cause; I know that I shall be justified. 

**¹⁹** Who *is* he *that* will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost. 

**²⁰** Only do not two *things* unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee. 

**²¹** Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid. 

**²²** Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me. 

**²³** How many *are* mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin. 

**²⁴** Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy? 

**²⁵** Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble? 

**²⁶** For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth. 

**²⁷** Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet. 

**²⁸** And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.
