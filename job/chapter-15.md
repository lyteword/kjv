# Job 15 

**¹** Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 

**²** Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? 

**³** Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good? 

**⁴** Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God. 

**⁵** For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. 

**⁶** Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee. 

**⁷** *Art* thou the first man *that* was born? or wast thou made before the hills? 

**⁸** Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? 

**⁹** What knowest thou, that we know not? *what* understandest thou, which *is* not in us? 

**¹⁰** With us *are* both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father. 

**¹¹** *Are* the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee? 

**¹²** Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at, 

**¹³** That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest *such* words go out of thy mouth? 

**¹⁴** What *is* man, that he should be clean? and *he which is* born of a woman, that he should be righteous? 

**¹⁵** Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight. 

**¹⁶** How much more abominable and filthy *is* man, which drinketh iniquity like water? 

**¹⁷** I will shew thee, hear me; and that *which* I have seen I will declare; 

**¹⁸** Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid *it:* 

**¹⁹** Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them. 

**²⁰** The wicked man travaileth with pain all *his* days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor. 

**²¹** A dreadful sound *is* in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him. 

**²²** He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword. 

**²³** He wandereth abroad for bread, *saying*, Where *is it*? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. 

**²⁴** Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle. 

**²⁵** For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty. 

**²⁶** He runneth upon him, *even* on *his* neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers: 

**²⁷** Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on *his* flanks. 

**²⁸** And he dwelleth in desolate cities, *and* in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps. 

**²⁹** He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth. 

**³⁰** He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away. 

**³¹** Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence. 

**³²** It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green. 

**³³** He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive. 

**³⁴** For the congregation of hypocrites *shall be* desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery. 

**³⁵** They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.
