# Chapter 26

**¹** But Job answered and said, 

**²** How hast thou helped *him that is* without power? *how* savest thou the arm *that hath* no strength? 

**³** How hast thou counselled *him that hath* no wisdom? and *how* hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is? 

**⁴** To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee? 

**⁵** Dead *things* are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof. 

**⁶** Hell *is* naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. 

**⁷** He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, *and* hangeth the earth upon nothing. 

**⁸** He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. 

**⁹** He holdeth back the face of his throne, *and* spreadeth his cloud upon it. 

**¹⁰** He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end. 

**¹¹** The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof. 

**¹²** He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud. 

**¹³** By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent. 

**¹⁴** Lo, these *are* parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?
