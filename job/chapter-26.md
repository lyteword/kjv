# Chapter 26

<sup>1</sup> But Job answered and said, 

<sup>2</sup> How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength? 

<sup>3</sup> How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is? 

<sup>4</sup> To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee? 

<sup>5</sup> Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof. 

<sup>6</sup> Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. 

<sup>7</sup> He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. 

<sup>8</sup> He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. 

<sup>9</sup> He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it. 

<sup>10</sup> He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end. 

<sup>11</sup> The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof. 

<sup>12</sup> He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud. 

<sup>13</sup> By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent. 

<sup>14</sup> Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?
