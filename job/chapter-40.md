# Chapter 40

<sup>1</sup> Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it. 

<sup>3</sup> ¶ Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 

<sup>4</sup> Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth. 

<sup>5</sup> Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further. 

<sup>6</sup> ¶ Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 

<sup>7</sup> Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. 

<sup>8</sup> Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? 

<sup>9</sup> Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? 

<sup>10</sup> Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty. 

<sup>11</sup> Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him. 

<sup>12</sup> Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place. 

<sup>13</sup> Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret. 

<sup>14</sup> Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee. 

<sup>15</sup> ¶ Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. 

<sup>16</sup> Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly. 

<sup>17</sup> He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. 

<sup>18</sup> His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron. 

<sup>19</sup> He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him. 

<sup>20</sup> Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. 

<sup>21</sup> He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens. 

<sup>22</sup> The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about. 

<sup>23</sup> Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. 

<sup>24</sup> He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.
