# Chapter 40

**¹** Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said, 

**²** Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct *him*? he that reproveth God, let him answer it. 

**³** ¶ Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 

**⁴** Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth. 

**⁵** Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further. 

**⁶** ¶ Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 

**⁷** Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. 

**⁸** Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? 

**⁹** Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? 

**¹⁰** Deck thyself now *with* majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty. 

**¹¹** Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one *that is* proud, and abase him. 

**¹²** Look on every one *that is* proud, *and* bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place. 

**¹³** Hide them in the dust together; *and* bind their faces in secret. 

**¹⁴** Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee. 

**¹⁵** ¶ Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. 

**¹⁶** Lo now, his strength *is* in his loins, and his force *is* in the navel of his belly. 

**¹⁷** He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. 

**¹⁸** His bones *are as* strong pieces of brass; his bones *are* like bars of iron. 

**¹⁹** He *is* the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach *unto him*. 

**²⁰** Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. 

**²¹** He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens. 

**²²** The shady trees cover him *with* their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about. 

**²³** Behold, he drinketh up a river, *and* hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. 

**²⁴** He taketh it with his eyes: *his* nose pierceth through snares.
