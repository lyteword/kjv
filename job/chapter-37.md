# Job 37 

**¹** At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place. 

**²** Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound *that* goeth out of his mouth. 

**³** He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth. 

**⁴** After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard. 

**⁵** God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend. 

**⁶** For he saith to the snow, Be thou *on* the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength. 

**⁷** He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work. 

**⁸** Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places. 

**⁹** Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north. 

**¹⁰** By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened. 

**¹¹** Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud: 

**¹²** And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth. 

**¹³** He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy. 

**¹⁴** Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. 

**¹⁵** Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine? 

**¹⁶** Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge? 

**¹⁷** How thy garments *are* warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south *wind*? 

**¹⁸** Hast thou with him spread out the sky, *which is* strong, *and* as a molten looking glass? 

**¹⁹** Teach us what we shall say unto him; *for* we cannot order *our speech* by reason of darkness. 

**²⁰** Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up. 

**²¹** And now *men* see not the bright light which *is* in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them. 

**²²** Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God *is* terrible majesty. 

**²³** *Touching* the Almighty, we cannot find him out: *he is* excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict. 

**²⁴** Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any *that are* wise of heart.
