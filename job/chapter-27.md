# Chapter 27

<sup>1</sup> Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 

<sup>2</sup> As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul; 

<sup>3</sup> All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils; 

<sup>4</sup> My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit. 

<sup>5</sup> God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me. 

<sup>6</sup> My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live. 

<sup>7</sup> Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous. 

<sup>8</sup> For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul? 

<sup>9</sup> Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him? 

<sup>10</sup> Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God? 

<sup>11</sup> I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal. 

<sup>12</sup> Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain? 

<sup>13</sup> This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty. 

<sup>14</sup> If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. 

<sup>15</sup> Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep. 

<sup>16</sup> Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay; 

<sup>17</sup> He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver. 

<sup>18</sup> He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh. 

<sup>19</sup> The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not. 

<sup>20</sup> Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night. 

<sup>21</sup> The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place. 

<sup>22</sup> For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand. 

<sup>23</sup> Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.
