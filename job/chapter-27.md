# Chapter 27

**¹** Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 

**²** *As* God liveth, *who* hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, *who* hath vexed my soul; 

**³** All the while my breath *is* in me, and the spirit of God *is* in my nostrils; 

**⁴** My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit. 

**⁵** God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me. 

**⁶** My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach *me* so long as I live. 

**⁷** Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous. 

**⁸** For what *is* the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul? 

**⁹** Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him? 

**¹⁰** Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God? 

**¹¹** I will teach you by the hand of God: *that* which *is* with the Almighty will I not conceal. 

**¹²** Behold, all ye yourselves have seen *it;* why then are ye thus altogether vain? 

**¹³** This *is* the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, *which* they shall receive of the Almighty. 

**¹⁴** If his children be multiplied, *it is* for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. 

**¹⁵** Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep. 

**¹⁶** Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay; 

**¹⁷** He may prepare *it*, but the just shall put *it* on, and the innocent shall divide the silver. 

**¹⁸** He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth *that* the keeper maketh. 

**¹⁹** The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he *is* not. 

**²⁰** Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night. 

**²¹** The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place. 

**²²** For *God* shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand. 

**²³** *Men* shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.
