# Job 10 

**¹** My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 

**²** I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me. 

**³** *Is it* good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked? 

**⁴** Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth? 

**⁵** *Are* thy days as the days of man? *are* thy years as man’s days, 

**⁶** That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin? 

**⁷** Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and *there is* none that can deliver out of thine hand. 

**⁸** Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me. 

**⁹** Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again? 

**¹⁰** Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese? 

**¹¹** Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews. 

**¹²** Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit. 

**¹³** And these *things* hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this *is* with thee. 

**¹⁴** If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity. 

**¹⁵** If I be wicked, woe unto me; and *if* I be righteous, *yet* will I not lift up my head. *I am* full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction; 

**¹⁶** For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me. 

**¹⁷** Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war *are* against me. 

**¹⁸** Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me! 

**¹⁹** I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. 

**²⁰** *Are* not my days few? cease *then, and* let me alone, that I may take comfort a little, 

**²¹** Before I go *whence* I shall not return, *even* to the land of darkness and the shadow of death; 

**²²** A land of darkness, as darkness *itself; and* of the shadow of death, without any order, and *where* the light *is* as darkness.
