# Job 5 

**¹** Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn? 

**²** For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one. 

**³** I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation. 

**⁴** His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither *is there* any to deliver *them*. 

**⁵** Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance. 

**⁶** Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground; 

**⁷** Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward. 

**⁸** I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause: 

**⁹** Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number: 

**¹⁰** Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields: 

**¹¹** To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety. 

**¹²** He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform *their* enterprise. 

**¹³** He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong. 

**¹⁴** They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night. 

**¹⁵** But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty. 

**¹⁶** So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth. 

**¹⁷** Behold, happy *is* the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty: 

**¹⁸** For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole. 

**¹⁹** He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee. 

**²⁰** In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword. 

**²¹** Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh. 

**²²** At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth. 

**²³** For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee. 

**²⁴** And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle *shall be* in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin. 

**²⁵** Thou shalt know also that thy seed *shall be* great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth. 

**²⁶** Thou shalt come to *thy* grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season. 

**²⁷** Lo this, we have searched it, so it *is;* hear it, and know thou *it* for thy good.
