# Chapter 24

**¹** Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days? 

**²** *Some* remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed *thereof*. 

**³** They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow’s ox for a pledge. 

**⁴** They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together. 

**⁵** Behold, *as* wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness *yieldeth* food for them *and* for *their* children. 

**⁶** They reap *every one* his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked. 

**⁷** They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that *they have* no covering in the cold. 

**⁸** They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. 

**⁹** They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor. 

**¹⁰** They cause *him* to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf *from* the hungry; 

**¹¹** *Which* make oil within their walls, *and* tread *their* winepresses, and suffer thirst. 

**¹²** Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly *to them*. 

**¹³** They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. 

**¹⁴** The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief. 

**¹⁵** The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth *his* face. 

**¹⁶** In the dark they dig through houses, *which* they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. 

**¹⁷** For the morning *is* to them even as the shadow of death: if *one* know *them, they are in* the terrors of the shadow of death. 

**¹⁸** He *is* swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards. 

**¹⁹** Drought and heat consume the snow waters: *so doth* the grave *those which* have sinned. 

**²⁰** The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree. 

**²¹** He evil entreateth the barren *that* beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow. 

**²²** He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no *man* is sure of life. 

**²³** *Though* it be given him *to be* in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes *are* upon their ways. 

**²⁴** They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all *other*, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn. 

**²⁵** And if *it be* not *so* now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?
