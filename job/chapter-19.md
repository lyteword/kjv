# Job 19 

**¹** Then Job answered and said, 

**²** How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words? 

**³** These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed *that* ye make yourselves strange to me. 

**⁴** And be it indeed *that* I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself. 

**⁵** If indeed ye will magnify *yourselves* against me, and plead against me my reproach: 

**⁶** Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net. 

**⁷** Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but *there is* no judgment. 

**⁸** He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths. 

**⁹** He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown *from* my head. 

**¹⁰** He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree. 

**¹¹** He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as *one of* his enemies. 

**¹²** His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle. 

**¹³** He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me. 

**¹⁴** My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me. 

**¹⁵** They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight. 

**¹⁶** I called my servant, and he gave *me* no answer; I intreated him with my mouth. 

**¹⁷** My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children’s *sake* of mine own body. 

**¹⁸** Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me. 

**¹⁹** All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me. 

**²⁰** My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth. 

**²¹** Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me. 

**²²** Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh? 

**²³** Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book! 

**²⁴** That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever! 

**²⁵** For I know *that* my redeemer liveth, and *that* he shall stand at the latter *day* upon the earth: 

**²⁶** And *though* after my skin *worms* destroy this *body*, yet in my flesh shall I see God: 

**²⁷** Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; *though* my reins be consumed within me. 

**²⁸** But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me? 

**²⁹** Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath *bringeth* the punishments of the sword, that ye may know *there is* a judgment.
