# Chapter 35

<sup>1</sup> Elihu spake moreover, and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Thinkest thou this to be right, *that* thou saidst, My righteousness *is* more than God’s? 

<sup>3</sup> For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? *and*, What profit shall I have, *if I be cleansed* from my sin? 

<sup>4</sup> I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee. 

<sup>5</sup> Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds *which* are higher than thou. 

<sup>6</sup> If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or *if* thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him? 

<sup>7</sup> If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? 

<sup>8</sup> Thy wickedness *may hurt* a man as thou *art;* and thy righteousness *may profit* the son of man. 

<sup>9</sup> By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make *the oppressed* to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty. 

<sup>10</sup> But none saith, Where *is* God my maker, who giveth songs in the night; 

<sup>11</sup> Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven? 

<sup>12</sup> There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men. 

<sup>13</sup> Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it. 

<sup>14</sup> Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, *yet* judgment *is* before him; therefore trust thou in him. 

<sup>15</sup> But now, because *it is* not *so*, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth *it* not in great extremity: 

<sup>16</sup> Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
