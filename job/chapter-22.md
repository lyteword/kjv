# Job 22 

**¹** Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 

**²** Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? 

**³** *Is it* any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or *is it* gain *to him*, that thou makest thy ways perfect? 

**⁴** Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment? 

**⁵** *Is* not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite? 

**⁶** For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing. 

**⁷** Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry. 

**⁸** But *as for* the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it. 

**⁹** Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken. 

**¹⁰** Therefore snares *are* round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee; 

**¹¹** Or darkness, *that* thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee. 

**¹²** *Is* not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are! 

**¹³** And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? 

**¹⁴** Thick clouds *are* a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven. 

**¹⁵** Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden? 

**¹⁶** Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood: 

**¹⁷** Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them? 

**¹⁸** Yet he filled their houses with good *things:* but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 

**¹⁹** The righteous see *it*, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn. 

**²⁰** Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth. 

**²¹** Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee. 

**²²** Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart. 

**²³** If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles. 

**²⁴** Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the *gold* of Ophir as the stones of the brooks. 

**²⁵** Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver. 

**²⁶** For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God. 

**²⁷** Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows. 

**²⁸** Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways. 

**²⁹** When *men* are cast down, then thou shalt say, *There is* lifting up; and he shall save the humble person. 

**³⁰** He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.
