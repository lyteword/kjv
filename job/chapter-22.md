# Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? 

<sup>3</sup> *Is it* any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or *is it* gain *to him*, that thou makest thy ways perfect? 

<sup>4</sup> Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment? 

<sup>5</sup> *Is* not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite? 

<sup>6</sup> For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing. 

<sup>7</sup> Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry. 

<sup>8</sup> But *as for* the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it. 

<sup>9</sup> Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken. 

<sup>10</sup> Therefore snares *are* round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee; 

<sup>11</sup> Or darkness, *that* thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee. 

<sup>12</sup> *Is* not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are! 

<sup>13</sup> And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? 

<sup>14</sup> Thick clouds *are* a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven. 

<sup>15</sup> Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden? 

<sup>16</sup> Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood: 

<sup>17</sup> Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them? 

<sup>18</sup> Yet he filled their houses with good *things:* but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 

<sup>19</sup> The righteous see *it*, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn. 

<sup>20</sup> Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth. 

<sup>21</sup> Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee. 

<sup>22</sup> Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart. 

<sup>23</sup> If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles. 

<sup>24</sup> Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the *gold* of Ophir as the stones of the brooks. 

<sup>25</sup> Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver. 

<sup>26</sup> For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God. 

<sup>27</sup> Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows. 

<sup>28</sup> Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways. 

<sup>29</sup> When *men* are cast down, then thou shalt say, *There is* lifting up; and he shall save the humble person. 

<sup>30</sup> He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.
