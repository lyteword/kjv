# Chapter 34

<sup>1</sup> Furthermore Elihu answered and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge. 

<sup>3</sup> For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat. 

<sup>4</sup> Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good. 

<sup>5</sup> For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment. 

<sup>6</sup> Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression. 

<sup>7</sup> What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water? 

<sup>8</sup> Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men. 

<sup>9</sup> For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God. 

<sup>10</sup> Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. 

<sup>11</sup> For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways. 

<sup>12</sup> Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment. 

<sup>13</sup> Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world? 

<sup>14</sup> If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; 

<sup>15</sup> All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust. 

<sup>16</sup> If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words. 

<sup>17</sup> Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just? 

<sup>18</sup> Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly? 

<sup>19</sup> How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands. 

<sup>20</sup> In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand. 

<sup>21</sup> For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. 

<sup>22</sup> There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. 

<sup>23</sup> For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God. 

<sup>24</sup> He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead. 

<sup>25</sup> Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed. 

<sup>26</sup> He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others; 

<sup>27</sup> Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways: 

<sup>28</sup> So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted. 

<sup>29</sup> When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only: 

<sup>30</sup> That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared. 

<sup>31</sup> Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more: 

<sup>32</sup> That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more. 

<sup>33</sup> Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest. 

<sup>34</sup> Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me. 

<sup>35</sup> Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom. 

<sup>36</sup> My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men. 

<sup>37</sup> For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
