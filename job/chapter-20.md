# Chapter 20

<sup>1</sup> Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for *this* I make haste. 

<sup>3</sup> I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer. 

<sup>4</sup> Knowest thou *not* this of old, since man was placed upon earth, 

<sup>5</sup> That the triumphing of the wicked *is* short, and the joy of the hypocrite *but* for a moment? 

<sup>6</sup> Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; 

<sup>7</sup> *Yet* he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where *is* he? 

<sup>8</sup> He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. 

<sup>9</sup> The eye also *which* saw him shall *see him* no more; neither shall his place any more behold him. 

<sup>10</sup> His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods. 

<sup>11</sup> His bones are full *of the sin* of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust. 

<sup>12</sup> Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, *though* he hide it under his tongue; 

<sup>13</sup> *Though* he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth: 

<sup>14</sup> *Yet* his meat in his bowels is turned, *it is* the gall of asps within him. 

<sup>15</sup> He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly. 

<sup>16</sup> He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper’s tongue shall slay him. 

<sup>17</sup> He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter. 

<sup>18</sup> That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow *it* down: according to *his* substance *shall* the restitution *be*, and he shall not rejoice *therein*. 

<sup>19</sup> Because he hath oppressed *and* hath forsaken the poor; *because* he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not; 

<sup>20</sup> Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired. 

<sup>21</sup> There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods. 

<sup>22</sup> In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him. 

<sup>23</sup> *When* he is about to fill his belly, *God* shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain *it* upon him while he is eating. 

<sup>24</sup> He shall flee from the iron weapon, *and* the bow of steel shall strike him through. 

<sup>25</sup> It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors *are* upon him. 

<sup>26</sup> All darkness *shall be* hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle. 

<sup>27</sup> The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him. 

<sup>28</sup> The increase of his house shall depart, *and his goods* shall flow away in the day of his wrath. 

<sup>29</sup> This *is* the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.
