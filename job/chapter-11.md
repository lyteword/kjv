# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified? 

<sup>3</sup> Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed? 

<sup>4</sup> For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes. 

<sup>5</sup> But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; 

<sup>6</sup> And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth. 

<sup>7</sup> Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? 

<sup>8</sup> It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know? 

<sup>9</sup> The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. 

<sup>10</sup> If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him? 

<sup>11</sup> For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it? 

<sup>12</sup> For vain man would be wise, though man be born like a wild assâ€™s colt. 

<sup>13</sup> If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him; 

<sup>14</sup> If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles. 

<sup>15</sup> For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear: 

<sup>16</sup> Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away: 

<sup>17</sup> And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning. 

<sup>18</sup> And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety. 

<sup>19</sup> Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee. 

<sup>20</sup> But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.
