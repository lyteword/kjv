# Job 11 

**¹** Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 

**²** Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified? 

**³** Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed? 

**⁴** For thou hast said, My doctrine *is* pure, and I am clean in thine eyes. 

**⁵** But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; 

**⁶** And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that *they are* double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee *less* than thine iniquity *deserveth*. 

**⁷** Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? 

**⁸** *It is* as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know? 

**⁹** The measure thereof *is* longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. 

**¹⁰** If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him? 

**¹¹** For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider *it*? 

**¹²** For vain man would be wise, though man be born *like* a wild ass’s colt. 

**¹³** If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him; 

**¹⁴** If iniquity *be* in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles. 

**¹⁵** For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear: 

**¹⁶** Because thou shalt forget *thy* misery, *and* remember *it* as waters *that* pass away: 

**¹⁷** And *thine* age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning. 

**¹⁸** And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig *about thee, and* thou shalt take thy rest in safety. 

**¹⁹** Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make *thee* afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee. 

**²⁰** But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope *shall be as* the giving up of the ghost.
