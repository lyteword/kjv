# Chapter 36

**¹** Elihu also proceeded, and said, 

**²** Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that *I have* yet to speak on God’s behalf. 

**³** I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 

**⁴** For truly my words *shall* not *be* false: he that is perfect in knowledge *is* with thee. 

**⁵** Behold, God *is* mighty, and despiseth not *any: he is* mighty in strength *and* wisdom. 

**⁶** He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor. 

**⁷** He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings *are they* on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted. 

**⁸** And if *they be* bound in fetters, *and* be holden in cords of affliction; 

**⁹** Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded. 

**¹⁰** He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity. 

**¹¹** If they obey and serve *him*, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. 

**¹²** But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge. 

**¹³** But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them. 

**¹⁴** They die in youth, and their life *is* among the unclean. 

**¹⁵** He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression. 

**¹⁶** Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait *into* a broad place, where *there is* no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table *should be* full of fatness. 

**¹⁷** But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold *on thee*. 

**¹⁸** Because *there is* wrath, *beware* lest he take thee away with *his* stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. 

**¹⁹** Will he esteem thy riches? *no*, not gold, nor all the forces of strength. 

**²⁰** Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place. 

**²¹** Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. 

**²²** Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him? 

**²³** Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity? 

**²⁴** Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold. 

**²⁵** Every man may see it; man may behold *it* afar off. 

**²⁶** Behold, God *is* great, and we know *him* not, neither can the number of his years be searched out. 

**²⁷** For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof: 

**²⁸** Which the clouds do drop *and* distil upon man abundantly. 

**²⁹** Also can *any* understand the spreadings of the clouds, *or* the noise of his tabernacle? 

**³⁰** Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea. 

**³¹** For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance. 

**³²** With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it *not to shine* by *the cloud* that cometh betwixt. 

**³³** The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.
