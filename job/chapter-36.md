# Chapter 36

<sup>1</sup> Elihu also proceeded, and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on Godâ€™s behalf. 

<sup>3</sup> I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 

<sup>4</sup> For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee. 

<sup>5</sup> Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom. 

<sup>6</sup> He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor. 

<sup>7</sup> He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted. 

<sup>8</sup> And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction; 

<sup>9</sup> Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded. 

<sup>10</sup> He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity. 

<sup>11</sup> If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. 

<sup>12</sup> But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge. 

<sup>13</sup> But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them. 

<sup>14</sup> They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean. 

<sup>15</sup> He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression. 

<sup>16</sup> Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness. 

<sup>17</sup> But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee. 

<sup>18</sup> Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. 

<sup>19</sup> Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength. 

<sup>20</sup> Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place. 

<sup>21</sup> Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. 

<sup>22</sup> Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him? 

<sup>23</sup> Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity? 

<sup>24</sup> Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold. 

<sup>25</sup> Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off. 

<sup>26</sup> Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out. 

<sup>27</sup> For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof: 

<sup>28</sup> Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly. 

<sup>29</sup> Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle? 

<sup>30</sup> Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea. 

<sup>31</sup> For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance. 

<sup>32</sup> With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt. 

<sup>33</sup> The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.
