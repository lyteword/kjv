# Job 8 

**¹** Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 

**²** How long wilt thou speak these *things*? and *how long shall* the words of thy mouth *be like* a strong wind? 

**³** Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice? 

**⁴** If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression; 

**⁵** If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; 

**⁶** If thou *wert* pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. 

**⁷** Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase. 

**⁸** For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers: 

**⁹** (For we *are but of* yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth *are* a shadow:) 

**¹⁰** Shall not they teach thee, *and* tell thee, and utter words out of their heart? 

**¹¹** Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water? 

**¹²** Whilst it *is* yet in his greenness, *and* not cut down, it withereth before any *other* herb. 

**¹³** So *are* the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite’s hope shall perish: 

**¹⁴** Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust *shall be* a spider’s web. 

**¹⁵** He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure. 

**¹⁶** He *is* green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden. 

**¹⁷** His roots are wrapped about the heap, *and* seeth the place of stones. 

**¹⁸** If he destroy him from his place, then *it* shall deny him, *saying*, I have not seen thee. 

**¹⁹** Behold, this *is* the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow. 

**²⁰** Behold, God will not cast away a perfect *man*, neither will he help the evil doers: 

**²¹** Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing. 

**²²** They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
