# Job 14 

**¹** Man *that is* born of a woman *is* of few days, and full of trouble. 

**²** He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. 

**³** And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee? 

**⁴** Who can bring a clean *thing* out of an unclean? not one. 

**⁵** Seeing his days *are* determined, the number of his months *are* with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; 

**⁶** Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day. 

**⁷** For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. 

**⁸** Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; 

**⁹** *Yet* through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant. 

**¹⁰** But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where *is* he? 

**¹¹** *As* the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up: 

**¹²** So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens *be* no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep. 

**¹³** O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me! 

**¹⁴** If a man die, shall he live *again*? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come. 

**¹⁵** Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands. 

**¹⁶** For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin? 

**¹⁷** My transgression *is* sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity. 

**¹⁸** And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place. 

**¹⁹** The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow *out* of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man. 

**²⁰** Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away. 

**²¹** His sons come to honour, and he knoweth *it* not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth *it* not of them. 

**²²** But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.
