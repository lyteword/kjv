# Job 6 

**¹** But Job answered and said, 

**²** Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together! 

**³** For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up. 

**⁴** For the arrows of the Almighty *are* within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me. 

**⁵** Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder? 

**⁶** Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there *any* taste in the white of an egg? 

**⁷** The things *that* my soul refused to touch *are* as my sorrowful meat. 

**⁸** Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant *me* the thing that I long for! 

**⁹** Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off! 

**¹⁰** Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. 

**¹¹** What *is* my strength, that I should hope? and what *is* mine end, that I should prolong my life? 

**¹²** *Is* my strength the strength of stones? or *is* my flesh of brass? 

**¹³** *Is* not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me? 

**¹⁴** To him that is afflicted pity *should be shewed* from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. 

**¹⁵** My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, *and* as the stream of brooks they pass away; 

**¹⁶** Which are blackish by reason of the ice, *and* wherein the snow is hid: 

**¹⁷** What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. 

**¹⁸** The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish. 

**¹⁹** The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them. 

**²⁰** They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed. 

**²¹** For now ye are nothing; ye see *my* casting down, and are afraid. 

**²²** Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance? 

**²³** Or, Deliver me from the enemy’s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty? 

**²⁴** Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred. 

**²⁵** How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove? 

**²⁶** Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, *which are* as wind? 

**²⁷** Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig *a pit* for your friend. 

**²⁸** Now therefore be content, look upon me; for *it is* evident unto you if I lie. 

**²⁹** Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness *is* in it. 

**³⁰** Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
