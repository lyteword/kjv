# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> But Job answered and said, 

<sup>2</sup> Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together! 

<sup>3</sup> For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up. 

<sup>4</sup> For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me. 

<sup>5</sup> Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder? 

<sup>6</sup> Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg? 

<sup>7</sup> The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat. 

<sup>8</sup> Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! 

<sup>9</sup> Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off! 

<sup>10</sup> Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. 

<sup>11</sup> What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life? 

<sup>12</sup> Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass? 

<sup>13</sup> Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me? 

<sup>14</sup> To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. 

<sup>15</sup> My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away; 

<sup>16</sup> Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid: 

<sup>17</sup> What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. 

<sup>18</sup> The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish. 

<sup>19</sup> The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them. 

<sup>20</sup> They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed. 

<sup>21</sup> For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid. 

<sup>22</sup> Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance? 

<sup>23</sup> Or, Deliver me from the enemyâ€™s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty? 

<sup>24</sup> Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred. 

<sup>25</sup> How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove? 

<sup>26</sup> Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind? 

<sup>27</sup> Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend. 

<sup>28</sup> Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie. 

<sup>29</sup> Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it. 

<sup>30</sup> Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
