# Job 41 

**¹** Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord *which* thou lettest down? 

**²** Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? 

**³** Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft *words* unto thee? 

**⁴** Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? 

**⁵** Wilt thou play with him as *with* a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? 

**⁶** Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants? 

**⁷** Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears? 

**⁸** Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more. 

**⁹** Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not *one* be cast down even at the sight of him? 

**¹⁰** None *is so* fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me? 

**¹¹** Who hath prevented me, that I should repay *him? whatsoever is* under the whole heaven is mine. 

**¹²** I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion. 

**¹³** Who can discover the face of his garment? *or* who can come *to him* with his double bridle? 

**¹⁴** Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth *are* terrible round about. 

**¹⁵** *His* scales *are his* pride, shut up together *as with* a close seal. 

**¹⁶** One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. 

**¹⁷** They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered. 

**¹⁸** By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes *are* like the eyelids of the morning. 

**¹⁹** Out of his mouth go burning lamps, *and* sparks of fire leap out. 

**²⁰** Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as *out* of a seething pot or caldron. 

**²¹** His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. 

**²²** In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him. 

**²³** The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved. 

**²⁴** His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether *millstone*. 

**²⁵** When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves. 

**²⁶** The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. 

**²⁷** He esteemeth iron as straw, *and* brass as rotten wood. 

**²⁸** The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble. 

**²⁹** Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear. 

**³⁰** Sharp stones *are* under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. 

**³¹** He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. 

**³²** He maketh a path to shine after him; *one* would think the deep *to be* hoary. 

**³³** Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear. 

**³⁴** He beholdeth all high *things:* he *is* a king over all the children of pride.
