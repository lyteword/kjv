# Chapter 41

<sup>1</sup> Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down? 

<sup>2</sup> Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? 

<sup>3</sup> Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee? 

<sup>4</sup> Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? 

<sup>5</sup> Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? 

<sup>6</sup> Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants? 

<sup>7</sup> Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears? 

<sup>8</sup> Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more. 

<sup>9</sup> Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him? 

<sup>10</sup> None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me? 

<sup>11</sup> Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine. 

<sup>12</sup> I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion. 

<sup>13</sup> Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle? 

<sup>14</sup> Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about. 

<sup>15</sup> His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. 

<sup>16</sup> One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. 

<sup>17</sup> They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered. 

<sup>18</sup> By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. 

<sup>19</sup> Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out. 

<sup>20</sup> Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron. 

<sup>21</sup> His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. 

<sup>22</sup> In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him. 

<sup>23</sup> The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved. 

<sup>24</sup> His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone. 

<sup>25</sup> When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves. 

<sup>26</sup> The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. 

<sup>27</sup> He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. 

<sup>28</sup> The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble. 

<sup>29</sup> Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear. 

<sup>30</sup> Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. 

<sup>31</sup> He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. 

<sup>32</sup> He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary. 

<sup>33</sup> Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear. 

<sup>34</sup> He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.
