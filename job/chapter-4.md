# Chapter 4

**¹** Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 

**²** *If* we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking? 

**³** Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands. 

**⁴** Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees. 

**⁵** But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. 

**⁶** *Is* not *this* thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways? 

**⁷** Remember, I pray thee, who *ever* perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off? 

**⁸** Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same. 

**⁹** By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed. 

**¹⁰** The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken. 

**¹¹** The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad. 

**¹²** Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof. 

**¹³** In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men, 

**¹⁴** Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake. 

**¹⁵** Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up: 

**¹⁶** It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image *was* before mine eyes, *there was* silence, and I heard a voice, *saying*, 

**¹⁷** Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker? 

**¹⁸** Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly: 

**¹⁹** How much less *in* them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation *is* in the dust, *which* are crushed before the moth? 

**²⁰** They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding *it*. 

**²¹** Doth not their excellency *which is* in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.
