# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 

<sup>2</sup> *If* we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking? 

<sup>3</sup> Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands. 

<sup>4</sup> Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees. 

<sup>5</sup> But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. 

<sup>6</sup> *Is* not *this* thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways? 

<sup>7</sup> Remember, I pray thee, who *ever* perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off? 

<sup>8</sup> Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same. 

<sup>9</sup> By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed. 

<sup>10</sup> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken. 

<sup>11</sup> The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad. 

<sup>12</sup> Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof. 

<sup>13</sup> In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men, 

<sup>14</sup> Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake. 

<sup>15</sup> Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up: 

<sup>16</sup> It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image *was* before mine eyes, *there was* silence, and I heard a voice, *saying*, 

<sup>17</sup> Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker? 

<sup>18</sup> Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly: 

<sup>19</sup> How much less *in* them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation *is* in the dust, *which* are crushed before the moth? 

<sup>20</sup> They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding *it*. 

<sup>21</sup> Doth not their excellency *which is* in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.
