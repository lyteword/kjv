# Chapter 39

<sup>1</sup> Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? 

<sup>2</sup> Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? 

<sup>3</sup> They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows. 

<sup>4</sup> Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them. 

<sup>5</sup> Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass? 

<sup>6</sup> Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings. 

<sup>7</sup> He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver. 

<sup>8</sup> The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing. 

<sup>9</sup> Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib? 

<sup>10</sup> Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee? 

<sup>11</sup> Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him? 

<sup>12</sup> Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn? 

<sup>13</sup> Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich? 

<sup>14</sup> Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust, 

<sup>15</sup> And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them. 

<sup>16</sup> She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers: her labour is in vain without fear; 

<sup>17</sup> Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding. 

<sup>18</sup> What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider. 

<sup>19</sup> Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? 

<sup>20</sup> Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible. 

<sup>21</sup> He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men. 

<sup>22</sup> He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword. 

<sup>23</sup> The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield. 

<sup>24</sup> He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet. 

<sup>25</sup> He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 

<sup>26</sup> Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south? 

<sup>27</sup> Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high? 

<sup>28</sup> She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place. 

<sup>29</sup> From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off. 

<sup>30</sup> Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.
