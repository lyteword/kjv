# Chapter 39

**¹** Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? *or* canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? 

**²** Canst thou number the months *that* they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? 

**³** They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows. 

**⁴** Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them. 

**⁵** Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass? 

**⁶** Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings. 

**⁷** He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver. 

**⁸** The range of the mountains *is* his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing. 

**⁹** Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib? 

**¹⁰** Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee? 

**¹¹** Wilt thou trust him, because his strength *is* great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him? 

**¹²** Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather *it into* thy barn? 

**¹³** *Gavest thou* the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich? 

**¹⁴** Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust, 

**¹⁵** And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them. 

**¹⁶** She is hardened against her young ones, as though *they were* not hers: her labour is in vain without fear; 

**¹⁷** Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding. 

**¹⁸** What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider. 

**¹⁹** Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? 

**²⁰** Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils *is* terrible. 

**²¹** He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in *his* strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men. 

**²²** He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword. 

**²³** The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield. 

**²⁴** He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that *it is* the sound of the trumpet. 

**²⁵** He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 

**²⁶** Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, *and* stretch her wings toward the south? 

**²⁷** Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high? 

**²⁸** She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place. 

**²⁹** From thence she seeketh the prey, *and* her eyes behold afar off. 

**³⁰** Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain *are*, there *is* she.
