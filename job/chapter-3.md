# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. 

<sup>2</sup> And Job spake, and said, 

<sup>3</sup> Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night *in which* it was said, There is a man child conceived. 

<sup>4</sup> Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it. 

<sup>5</sup> Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. 

<sup>6</sup> As *for* that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months. 

<sup>7</sup> Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein. 

<sup>8</sup> Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning. 

<sup>9</sup> Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but *have* none; neither let it see the dawning of the day: 

<sup>10</sup> Because it shut not up the doors of my *mother’s* womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes. 

<sup>11</sup> Why died I not from the womb? *why* did I *not* give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? 

<sup>12</sup> Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck? 

<sup>13</sup> For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest, 

<sup>14</sup> With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves; 

<sup>15</sup> Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver: 

<sup>16</sup> Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants *which* never saw light. 

<sup>17</sup> There the wicked cease *from* troubling; and there the weary be at rest. 

<sup>18</sup> *There* the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor. 

<sup>19</sup> The small and great are there; and the servant *is* free from his master. 

<sup>20</sup> Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter *in* soul; 

<sup>21</sup> Which long for death, but it *cometh* not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures; 

<sup>22</sup> Which rejoice exceedingly, *and* are glad, when they can find the grave? 

<sup>23</sup> *Why is light given* to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in? 

<sup>24</sup> For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters. 

<sup>25</sup> For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me. 

<sup>26</sup> I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
