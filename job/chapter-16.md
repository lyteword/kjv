# Job 16 

**¹** Then Job answered and said, 

**²** I have heard many such things: miserable comforters *are* ye all. 

**³** Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest? 

**⁴** I also could speak as ye *do:* if your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you. 

**⁵** *But* I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage *your grief*. 

**⁶** Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and *though* I forbear, what am I eased? 

**⁷** But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company. 

**⁸** And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, *which* is a witness *against me:* and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face. 

**⁹** He teareth *me* in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me. 

**¹⁰** They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me. 

**¹¹** God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked. 

**¹²** I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken *me* by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark. 

**¹³** His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground. 

**¹⁴** He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant. 

**¹⁵** I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust. 

**¹⁶** My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids *is* the shadow of death; 

**¹⁷** Not for *any* injustice in mine hands: also my prayer *is* pure. 

**¹⁸** O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place. 

**¹⁹** Also now, behold, my witness *is* in heaven, and my record *is* on high. 

**²⁰** My friends scorn me: *but* mine eye poureth out *tears* unto God. 

**²¹** O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man *pleadeth* for his neighbour! 

**²²** When a few years are come, then I shall go the way *whence* I shall not return.
