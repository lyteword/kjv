# Job 38 

**¹** Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 

**²** Who *is* this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? 

**³** Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. 

**⁴** Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. 

**⁵** Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? 

**⁶** Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; 

**⁷** When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? 

**⁸** Or *who* shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, *as if* it had issued out of the womb? 

**⁹** When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it, 

**¹⁰** And brake up for it my decreed *place*, and set bars and doors, 

**¹¹** And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed? 

**¹²** Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; *and* caused the dayspring to know his place; 

**¹³** That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it? 

**¹⁴** It is turned as clay *to* the seal; and they stand as a garment. 

**¹⁵** And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken. 

**¹⁶** Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? 

**¹⁷** Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death? 

**¹⁸** Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all. 

**¹⁹** Where *is* the way *where* light dwelleth? and *as for* darkness, where *is* the place thereof, 

**²⁰** That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths *to* the house thereof? 

**²¹** Knowest thou *it*, because thou wast then born? or *because* the number of thy days *is* great? 

**²²** Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, 

**²³** Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war? 

**²⁴** By what way is the light parted, *which* scattereth the east wind upon the earth? 

**²⁵** Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder; 

**²⁶** To cause it to rain on the earth, *where* no man *is; on* the wilderness, wherein *there is* no man; 

**²⁷** To satisfy the desolate and waste *ground;* and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth? 

**²⁸** Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew? 

**²⁹** Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? 

**³⁰** The waters are hid as *with* a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen. 

**³¹** Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? 

**³²** Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? 

**³³** Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? 

**³⁴** Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee? 

**³⁵** Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we *are*? 

**³⁶** Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart? 

**³⁷** Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven, 

**³⁸** When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together? 

**³⁹** Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions, 

**⁴⁰** When they couch in *their* dens, *and* abide in the covert to lie in wait? 

**⁴¹** Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.
