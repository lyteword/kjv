# Job 18 

**¹** Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 

**²** How long *will it be ere* ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak. 

**³** Wherefore are we counted as beasts, *and* reputed vile in your sight? 

**⁴** He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place? 

**⁵** Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine. 

**⁶** The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him. 

**⁷** The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down. 

**⁸** For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare. 

**⁹** The gin shall take *him* by the heel, *and* the robber shall prevail against him. 

**¹⁰** The snare *is* laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way. 

**¹¹** Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet. 

**¹²** His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction *shall be* ready at his side. 

**¹³** It shall devour the strength of his skin: *even* the firstborn of death shall devour his strength. 

**¹⁴** His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors. 

**¹⁵** It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because *it is* none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation. 

**¹⁶** His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off. 

**¹⁷** His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street. 

**¹⁸** He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world. 

**¹⁹** He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings. 

**²⁰** They that come after *him* shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted. 

**²¹** Surely such *are* the dwellings of the wicked, and this *is* the place *of him that* knoweth not God.
