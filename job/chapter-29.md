# Job 29 

**¹** Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 

**²** Oh that I were as *in* months past, as *in* the days *when* God preserved me; 

**³** When his candle shined upon my head, *and when* by his light I walked *through* darkness; 

**⁴** As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God *was* upon my tabernacle; 

**⁵** When the Almighty *was* yet with me, *when* my children *were* about me; 

**⁶** When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil; 

**⁷** When I went out to the gate through the city, *when* I prepared my seat in the street! 

**⁸** The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, *and* stood up. 

**⁹** The princes refrained talking, and laid *their* hand on their mouth. 

**¹⁰** The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. 

**¹¹** When the ear heard *me*, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw *me*, it gave witness to me: 

**¹²** Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and *him that had* none to help him. 

**¹³** The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy. 

**¹⁴** I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment *was* as a robe and a diadem. 

**¹⁵** I was eyes to the blind, and feet *was* I to the lame. 

**¹⁶** I *was* a father to the poor: and the cause *which* I knew not I searched out. 

**¹⁷** And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth. 

**¹⁸** Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply *my* days as the sand. 

**¹⁹** My root *was* spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch. 

**²⁰** My glory *was* fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand. 

**²¹** Unto me *men* gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel. 

**²²** After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them. 

**²³** And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide *as* for the latter rain. 

**²⁴** *If* I laughed on them, they believed *it* not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down. 

**²⁵** I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one *that* comforteth the mourners.
