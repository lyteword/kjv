# Job 21 

**¹** But Job answered and said, 

**²** Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. 

**³** Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on. 

**⁴** As for me, *is* my complaint to man? and if *it were so*, why should not my spirit be troubled? 

**⁵** Mark me, and be astonished, and lay *your* hand upon *your* mouth. 

**⁶** Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh. 

**⁷** Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? 

**⁸** Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes. 

**⁹** Their houses *are* safe from fear, neither *is* the rod of God upon them. 

**¹⁰** Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. 

**¹¹** They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance. 

**¹²** They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. 

**¹³** They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. 

**¹⁴** Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. 

**¹⁵** What *is* the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? 

**¹⁶** Lo, their good *is* not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 

**¹⁷** How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and *how oft* cometh their destruction upon them! *God* distributeth sorrows in his anger. 

**¹⁸** They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away. 

**¹⁹** God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know *it*. 

**²⁰** His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 

**²¹** For what pleasure *hath* he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst? 

**²²** Shall *any* teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high. 

**²³** One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. 

**²⁴** His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow. 

**²⁵** And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. 

**²⁶** They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them. 

**²⁷** Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices *which* ye wrongfully imagine against me. 

**²⁸** For ye say, Where *is* the house of the prince? and where *are* the dwelling places of the wicked? 

**²⁹** Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens, 

**³⁰** That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. 

**³¹** Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him *what* he hath done? 

**³²** Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. 

**³³** The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as *there are* innumerable before him. 

**³⁴** How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?
