# Chapter 28

**¹** Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold *where* they fine *it*. 

**²** Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass *is* molten *out of* the stone. 

**³** He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death. 

**⁴** The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; *even the waters* forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men. 

**⁵** *As for* the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire. 

**⁶** The stones of it *are* the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold. 

**⁷** *There is* a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture’s eye hath not seen: 

**⁸** The lion’s whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it. 

**⁹** He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots. 

**¹⁰** He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing. 

**¹¹** He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and *the thing that is* hid bringeth he forth to light. 

**¹²** But where shall wisdom be found? and where *is* the place of understanding? 

**¹³** Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. 

**¹⁴** The depth saith, It *is* not in me: and the sea saith, *It is* not with me. 

**¹⁵** It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed *for* the price thereof. 

**¹⁶** It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. 

**¹⁷** The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it *shall not be for* jewels of fine gold. 

**¹⁸** No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom *is* above rubies. 

**¹⁹** The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold. 

**²⁰** Whence then cometh wisdom? and where *is* the place of understanding? 

**²¹** Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air. 

**²²** Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears. 

**²³** God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof. 

**²⁴** For he looketh to the ends of the earth, *and* seeth under the whole heaven; 

**²⁵** To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure. 

**²⁶** When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder: 

**²⁷** Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out. 

**²⁸** And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that *is* wisdom; and to depart from evil *is* understanding.
