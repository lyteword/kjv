# Job 30 

**¹** But now *they that are* younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock. 

**²** Yea, whereto *might* the strength of their hands *profit* me, in whom old age was perished? 

**³** For want and famine *they were* solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste. 

**⁴** Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots *for* their meat. 

**⁵** They were driven forth from among *men*, (they cried after them as *after* a thief;) 

**⁶** To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, *in* caves of the earth, and *in* the rocks. 

**⁷** Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together. 

**⁸** *They were* children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth. 

**⁹** And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword. 

**¹⁰** They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face. 

**¹¹** Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me. 

**¹²** Upon *my* right *hand* rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction. 

**¹³** They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper. 

**¹⁴** They came *upon me* as a wide breaking in *of waters:* in the desolation they rolled themselves *upon me*. 

**¹⁵** Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud. 

**¹⁶** And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me. 

**¹⁷** My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest. 

**¹⁸** By the great force *of my disease* is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat. 

**¹⁹** He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes. 

**²⁰** I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me *not*. 

**²¹** Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me. 

**²²** Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride *upon it*, and dissolvest my substance. 

**²³** For I know *that* thou wilt bring me *to* death, and *to* the house appointed for all living. 

**²⁴** Howbeit he will not stretch out *his* hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction. 

**²⁵** Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was *not* my soul grieved for the poor? 

**²⁶** When I looked for good, then evil came *unto me:* and when I waited for light, there came darkness. 

**²⁷** My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me. 

**²⁸** I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, *and* I cried in the congregation. 

**²⁹** I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls. 

**³⁰** My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat. 

**³¹** My harp also is *turned* to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.
