# Chapter 31

<sup>1</sup> I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid? 

<sup>2</sup> For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high? 

<sup>3</sup> Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity? 

<sup>4</sup> Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps? 

<sup>5</sup> If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit; 

<sup>6</sup> Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity. 

<sup>7</sup> If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; 

<sup>8</sup> Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out. 

<sup>9</sup> If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour’s door; 

<sup>10</sup> Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her. 

<sup>11</sup> For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges. 

<sup>12</sup> For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase. 

<sup>13</sup> If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me; 

<sup>14</sup> What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? 

<sup>15</sup> Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb? 

<sup>16</sup> If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; 

<sup>17</sup> Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof; 

<sup>18</sup> (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother’s womb;) 

<sup>19</sup> If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering; 

<sup>20</sup> If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; 

<sup>21</sup> If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate: 

<sup>22</sup> Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone. 

<sup>23</sup> For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure. 

<sup>24</sup> If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence; 

<sup>25</sup> If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much; 

<sup>26</sup> If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness; 

<sup>27</sup> And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: 

<sup>28</sup> This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above. 

<sup>29</sup> If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him: 

<sup>30</sup> Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul. 

<sup>31</sup> If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied. 

<sup>32</sup> The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller. 

<sup>33</sup> If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom: 

<sup>34</sup> Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door? 

<sup>35</sup> Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book. 

<sup>36</sup> Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me. 

<sup>37</sup> I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him. 

<sup>38</sup> If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain; 

<sup>39</sup> If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: 

<sup>40</sup> Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
