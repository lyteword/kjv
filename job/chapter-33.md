# Chapter 33

**¹** Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words. 

**²** Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth. 

**³** My words *shall be of* the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly. 

**⁴** The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life. 

**⁵** If thou canst answer me, set *thy words* in order before me, stand up. 

**⁶** Behold, I *am* according to thy wish in God’s stead: I also am formed out of the clay. 

**⁷** Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee. 

**⁸** Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of *thy* words, *saying*, 

**⁹** I am clean without transgression, I *am* innocent; neither *is there* iniquity in me. 

**¹⁰** Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy, 

**¹¹** He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths. 

**¹²** Behold, *in* this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man. 

**¹³** Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters. 

**¹⁴** For God speaketh once, yea twice, *yet man* perceiveth it not. 

**¹⁵** In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; 

**¹⁶** Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction, 

**¹⁷** That he may withdraw man *from his* purpose, and hide pride from man. 

**¹⁸** He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. 

**¹⁹** He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong *pain:* 

**²⁰** So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat. 

**²¹** His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones *that* were not seen stick out. 

**²²** Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers. 

**²³** If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness: 

**²⁴** Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom. 

**²⁵** His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth: 

**²⁶** He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness. 

**²⁷** He looketh upon men, and *if any* say, I have sinned, and perverted *that which was* right, and it profited me not; 

**²⁸** He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light. 

**²⁹** Lo, all these *things* worketh God oftentimes with man, 

**³⁰** To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living. 

**³¹** Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak. 

**³²** If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee. 

**³³** If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
