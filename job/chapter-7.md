# Job 7 

**¹** *Is there* not an appointed time to man upon earth? *are not* his days also like the days of an hireling? 

**²** As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for *the reward of* his work: 

**³** So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me. 

**⁴** When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day. 

**⁵** My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome. 

**⁶** My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope. 

**⁷** O remember that my life *is* wind: mine eye shall no more see good. 

**⁸** The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no *more:* thine eyes *are* upon me, and I *am* not. 

**⁹** *As* the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no *more*. 

**¹⁰** He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more. 

**¹¹** Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 

**¹²** *Am* I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me? 

**¹³** When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint; 

**¹⁴** Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions: 

**¹⁵** So that my soul chooseth strangling, *and* death rather than my life. 

**¹⁶** I loathe *it;* I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days *are* vanity. 

**¹⁷** What *is* man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him? 

**¹⁸** And *that* thou shouldest visit him every morning, *and* try him every moment? 

**¹⁹** How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle? 

**²⁰** I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself? 

**²¹** And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I *shall* not *be*.
