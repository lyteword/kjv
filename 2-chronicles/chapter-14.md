# Chapter 14

<sup>1</sup> So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years. 

<sup>2</sup> And Asa did *that which was* good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God: 

<sup>3</sup> For he took away the altars of the strange *gods*, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves: 

<sup>4</sup> And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment. 

<sup>5</sup> Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him. 

<sup>6</sup> ¶ And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest. 

<sup>7</sup> Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about *them* walls, and towers, gates, and bars, *while* the land *is* yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought *him*, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered. 

<sup>8</sup> And Asa had an army *of men* that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these *were* mighty men of valour. 

<sup>9</sup> ¶ And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah. 

<sup>10</sup> Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. 

<sup>11</sup> And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, *it is* nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou *art* our God; let not man prevail against thee. 

<sup>12</sup> So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. 

<sup>13</sup> And Asa and the people that *were* with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil. 

<sup>14</sup> And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them. 

<sup>15</sup> They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.
