# Chapter 1

**¹** Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, *which is* our hope; 

**²** Unto Timothy, *my* own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, *and* peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. 

**³** As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine, 

**⁴** Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: *so do*. 

**⁵** Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and *of* a good conscience, and *of* faith unfeigned: 

**⁶** From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling; 

**⁷** Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm. 

**⁸** But we know that the law *is* good, if a man use it lawfully; 

**⁹** Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, 

**¹⁰** For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine; 

**¹¹** According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust. 

**¹²** And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; 

**¹³** Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did *it* ignorantly in unbelief. 

**¹⁴** And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 

**¹⁵** This *is* a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. 

**¹⁶** Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. 

**¹⁷** Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, *be* honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen. 

**¹⁸** This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare; 

**¹⁹** Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck: 

**²⁰** Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
