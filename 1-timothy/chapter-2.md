# 1 Timothy 2 

**¹** I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, *and* giving of thanks, be made for all men; 

**²** For kings, and *for* all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. 

**³** For this *is* good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; 

**⁴** Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. 

**⁵** For *there is* one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; 

**⁶** Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. 

**⁷** Where unto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, *and* lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. 

**⁸** I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. 

**⁹** In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; 

**¹⁰** But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works. 

**¹¹** Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. 

**¹²** But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. 

**¹³** For Adam was first formed, then Eve. 

**¹⁴** And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. 

**¹⁵** Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.
