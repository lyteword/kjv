# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, *and* giving of thanks, be made for all men; 

<sup>2</sup> For kings, and *for* all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. 

<sup>3</sup> For this *is* good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; 

<sup>4</sup> Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. 

<sup>5</sup> For *there is* one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; 

<sup>6</sup> Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. 

<sup>7</sup> Where unto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, *and* lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. 

<sup>8</sup> I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. 

<sup>9</sup> In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; 

<sup>10</sup> But( which becometh women professing godliness) with good works. 

<sup>11</sup> Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. 

<sup>12</sup> But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. 

<sup>13</sup> For Adam was first formed, then Eve. 

<sup>14</sup> And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. 

<sup>15</sup> Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.
