# 1 Timothy 4 

**¹** Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; 

**²** Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; 

**³** Forbidding to marry, *and commanding* to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. 

**⁴** For every creature of God *is* good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: 

**⁵** For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. 

**⁶** If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. 

**⁷** But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself *rather* unto godliness. 

**⁸** For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. 

**⁹** This *is* a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. 

**¹⁰** For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe. 

**¹¹** These things command and teach. 

**¹²** Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. 

**¹³** Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. 

**¹⁴** Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. 

**¹⁵** Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all. 

**¹⁶** Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.
