# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. 

<sup>2</sup> Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. 

<sup>3</sup> And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. 

<sup>4</sup> Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law. 

<sup>5</sup> And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin. 

<sup>6</sup> Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him. 

<sup>7</sup> Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. 

<sup>8</sup> He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. 

<sup>9</sup> Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. 

<sup>10</sup> In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. 

<sup>11</sup> For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. 

<sup>12</sup> Not as Cain, *who* was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother’s righteous. 

<sup>13</sup> Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. 

<sup>14</sup> We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not *his* brother abideth in death. 

<sup>15</sup> Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. 

<sup>16</sup> Hereby perceive we the love **, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down *our* lives for the brethren. 

<sup>17</sup> But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels *of compassion* from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? 

<sup>18</sup> My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. 

<sup>19</sup> And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him. 

<sup>20</sup> For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. 

<sup>21</sup> Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, *then* have we confidence toward God. 

<sup>22</sup> And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. 

<sup>23</sup> And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. 

<sup>24</sup> And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.
