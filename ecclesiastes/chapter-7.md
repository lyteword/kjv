# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> A good name *is* better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one’s birth. 

<sup>2</sup> ¶ *It is* better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that *is* the end of all men; and the living will lay *it* to his heart. 

<sup>3</sup> Sorrow *is* better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better. 

<sup>4</sup> The heart of the wise *is* in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools *is* in the house of mirth. 

<sup>5</sup> *It is* better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. 

<sup>6</sup> For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so *is* the laughter of the fool: this also *is* vanity. 

<sup>7</sup> ¶ Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart. 

<sup>8</sup> Better *is* the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: *and* the patient in spirit *is* better than the proud in spirit. 

<sup>9</sup> Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools. 

<sup>10</sup> Say not thou, What is *the cause* that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this. 

<sup>11</sup> ¶ Wisdom *is* good with an inheritance: and *by it there is* profit to them that see the sun. 

<sup>12</sup> For wisdom *is* a defence, *and* money *is* a defence: but the excellency of knowledge *is, that* wisdom giveth life to them that have it. 

<sup>13</sup> Consider the work of God: for who can make *that* straight, which he hath made crooked? 

<sup>14</sup> In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him. 

<sup>15</sup> All *things* have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just *man* that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked *man* that prolongeth *his life* in his wickedness. 

<sup>16</sup> Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself? 

<sup>17</sup> Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? 

<sup>18</sup> *It is* good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all. 

<sup>19</sup> Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty *men* which are in the city. 

<sup>20</sup> For *there is* not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not. 

<sup>21</sup> Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee: 

<sup>22</sup> For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others. 

<sup>23</sup> ¶ All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it *was* far from me. 

<sup>24</sup> That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out? 

<sup>25</sup> I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason *of things*, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness *and* madness: 

<sup>26</sup> And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart *is* snares and nets, *and* her hands *as* bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her. 

<sup>27</sup> Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, *counting* one by one, to find out the account: 

<sup>28</sup> Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found. 

<sup>29</sup> Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.
