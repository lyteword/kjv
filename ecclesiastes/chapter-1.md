# Ecclesiastes 1 

**¹** The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. 

**²** Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all *is* vanity. 

**³** What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun? 

**⁴** *One* generation passeth away, and *another* generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. 

**⁵** The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose. 

**⁶** The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits. 

**⁷** All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea *is* not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again. 

**⁸** All things *are* full of labour; man cannot utter *it:* the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. 

**⁹** The thing that hath been, it *is that* which shall be; and that which is done *is* that which shall be done: and *there is* no new *thing* under the sun. 

**¹⁰** Is there *any* thing whereof it may be said, See, this *is* new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us. 

**¹¹** *There is* no remembrance of former *things;* neither shall there be *any* remembrance of *things* that are to come with *those* that shall come after. 

**¹²** ¶ I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 

**¹³** And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all *things* that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. 

**¹⁴** I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all *is* vanity and vexation of spirit. 

**¹⁵** *That which is* crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. 

**¹⁶** I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all *they* that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. 

**¹⁷** And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. 

**¹⁸** For in much wisdom *is* much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
