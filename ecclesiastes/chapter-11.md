# Chapter 11

**¹** Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days. 

**²** Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth. 

**³** If the clouds be full of rain, they empty *themselves* upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be. 

**⁴** He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. 

**⁵** As thou knowest not what *is* the way of the spirit, *nor* how the bones *do grow* in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all. 

**⁶** In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both *shall be* alike good. 

**⁷** ¶ Truly the light *is* sweet, and a pleasant *thing it is* for the eyes to behold the sun: 

**⁸** But if a man live many years, *and* rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh *is* vanity. 

**⁹** ¶ Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these *things* God will bring thee into judgment. 

**¹⁰** Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth *are* vanity.
