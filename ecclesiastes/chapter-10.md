# Ecclesiastes 10 

**¹** Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: *so doth* a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom *and* honour. 

**²** A wise man’s heart *is* at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left. 

**³** Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth *him*, and he saith to every one *that* he *is* a fool. 

**⁴** If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences. 

**⁵** There is an evil *which* I have seen under the sun, as an error *which* proceedeth from the ruler: 

**⁶** Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place. 

**⁷** I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth. 

**⁸** He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him. 

**⁹** Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; *and* he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby. 

**¹⁰** If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom *is* profitable to direct. 

**¹¹** Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better. 

**¹²** The words of a wise man’s mouth *are* gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. 

**¹³** The beginning of the words of his mouth *is* foolishness: and the end of his talk *is* mischievous madness. 

**¹⁴** A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him? 

**¹⁵** The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city. 

**¹⁶** ¶ Woe to thee, O land, when thy king *is* a child, and thy princes eat in the morning! 

**¹⁷** Blessed *art* thou, O land, when thy king *is* the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness! 

**¹⁸** ¶ By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through. 

**¹⁹** ¶ A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all *things*. 

**²⁰** ¶ Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.
