# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of *such as were* oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors *there was* power; but they had no comforter. 

<sup>2</sup> Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive. 

<sup>3</sup> Yea, better *is he* than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. 

<sup>4</sup> ¶ Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This *is* also vanity and vexation of spirit. 

<sup>5</sup> The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. 

<sup>6</sup> Better *is* an handful *with* quietness, than both the hands full *with* travail and vexation of spirit. 

<sup>7</sup> ¶ Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun. 

<sup>8</sup> There is one *alone*, and *there is* not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet *is there* no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither *saith he*, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This *is* also vanity, yea, it *is* a sore travail. 

<sup>9</sup> ¶ Two *are* better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. 

<sup>10</sup> For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him *that is* alone when he falleth; for *he hath* not another to help him up. 

<sup>11</sup> Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm *alone*? 

<sup>12</sup> And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. 

<sup>13</sup> ¶ Better *is* a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished. 

<sup>14</sup> For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also *he that is* born in his kingdom becometh poor. 

<sup>15</sup> I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead. 

<sup>16</sup> *There is* no end of all the people, *even* of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also *is* vanity and vexation of spirit.
