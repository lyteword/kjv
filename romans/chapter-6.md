# Romans 6 

**¹** What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? 

**²** God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? 

**³** Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? 

**⁴** Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. 

**⁵** For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also *in the likeness* of *his* resurrection: 

**⁶** Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with *him*, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. 

**⁷** For he that is dead is freed from sin. 

**⁸** Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him: 

**⁹** Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. 

**¹⁰** For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. 

**¹¹** Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. 

**¹²** Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. 

**¹³** Neither yield ye your members *as* instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members *as* instruments of righteousness unto God. 

**¹⁴** For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. 

**¹⁵** What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. 

**¹⁶** Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? 

**¹⁷** But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. 

**¹⁸** Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. 

**¹⁹** I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness. 

**²⁰** For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. 

**²¹** What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things *is* death. 

**²²** But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. 

**²³** For the wages of sin *is* death; but the gift of God *is* eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
