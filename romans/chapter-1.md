# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called *to be* an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, 

<sup>2</sup> (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,) 

<sup>3</sup> Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; 

<sup>4</sup> And declared *to be* the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: 

<sup>5</sup> By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name: 

<sup>6</sup> Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ: 

<sup>7</sup> To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called *to be* saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

<sup>8</sup> First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. 

<sup>9</sup> For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers; 

<sup>10</sup> Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you. 

<sup>11</sup> For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established; 

<sup>12</sup> That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me. 

<sup>13</sup> Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles. 

<sup>14</sup> I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise. 

<sup>15</sup> So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also. 

<sup>16</sup> For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. 

<sup>17</sup> For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. 

<sup>18</sup> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; 

<sup>19</sup> Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed *it* unto them. 

<sup>20</sup> For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, *even* his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: 

<sup>21</sup> Because that, when they knew God, they glorified *him* not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. 

<sup>22</sup> Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 

<sup>23</sup> And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. 

<sup>24</sup> Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: 

<sup>25</sup> Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. 

<sup>26</sup> For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: 

<sup>27</sup> And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. 

<sup>28</sup> And even as they did not like to retain God in *their* knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; 

<sup>29</sup> Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, 

<sup>30</sup> Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 

<sup>31</sup> Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: 

<sup>32</sup> Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
