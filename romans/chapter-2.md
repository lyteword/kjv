# Chapter 2

**¹** Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things. 

**²** But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things. 

**³** And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? 

**⁴** Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? 

**⁵** But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; 

**⁶** Who will render to every man according to his deeds: 

**⁷** To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life: 

**⁸** But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, 

**⁹** Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; 

**¹⁰** But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: 

**¹¹** For there is no respect of persons with God. 

**¹²** For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law; 

**¹³** (For not the hearers of the law *are* just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified. 

**¹⁴** For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: 

**¹⁵** Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and *their* thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;) 

**¹⁶** In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel. 

**¹⁷** Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God, 

**¹⁸** And knowest *his* will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law; 

**¹⁹** And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness, 

**²⁰** An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law. 

**²¹** Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? 

**²²** Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? 

**²³** Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God? 

**²⁴** For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written. 

**²⁵** For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. 

**²⁶** Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? 

**²⁷** And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law? 

**²⁸** For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither *is that* circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: 

**²⁹** But he *is* a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision *is that* of the heart, in the spirit, *and* not in the letter; whose praise *is* not of men, but of God.
