# Romans 9 

**¹** I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost, 

**²** That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. 

**³** For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: 

**⁴** Who are Israelites; to whom *pertaineth* the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service *of God*, and the promises; 

**⁵** Whose *are* the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ *came*, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen. 

**⁶** Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they *are* not all Israel, which are of Israel: 

**⁷** Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, *are they* all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called. 

**⁸** That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these *are* not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. 

**⁹** For this *is* the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son. 

**¹⁰** And not only *this*; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, *even* by our father Isaac; 

**¹¹** (For *the children* being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;) 

**¹²** It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. 

**¹³** As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. 

**¹⁴** What shall we say then? *Is there* unrighteousness with God? God forbid. 

**¹⁵** For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. 

**¹⁶** So then *it is* not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. 

**¹⁷** For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. 

**¹⁸** Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will *have mercy*, and whom he will he hardeneth. 

**¹⁹** Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will? 

**²⁰** Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed *it*, Why hast thou made me thus? 

**²¹** Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? 

**²²** *What* if God, willing to shew *his* wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: 

**²³** And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, 

**²⁴** Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles? 

**²⁵** As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. 

**²⁶** And it shall come to pass, *that* in the place where it was said unto them, Ye *are* not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God. 

**²⁷** Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved: 

**²⁸** For he will finish the work, and cut *it* short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth. 

**²⁹** And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha. 

**³⁰** What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith. 

**³¹** But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. 

**³²** Wherefore? Because *they sought it* not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; 

**³³** As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
