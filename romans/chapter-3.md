# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision? 

<sup>2</sup> Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God. 

<sup>3</sup> For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? 

<sup>4</sup> God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged. 

<sup>5</sup> But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man) 

<sup>6</sup> God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world? 

<sup>7</sup> For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner? 

<sup>8</sup> And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just. 

<sup>9</sup> What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin; 

<sup>10</sup> As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: 

<sup>11</sup> There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. 

<sup>12</sup> They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. 

<sup>13</sup> Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: 

<sup>14</sup> Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: 

<sup>15</sup> Their feet are swift to shed blood: 

<sup>16</sup> Destruction and misery are in their ways: 

<sup>17</sup> And the way of peace have they not known: 

<sup>18</sup> There is no fear of God before their eyes. 

<sup>19</sup> Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. 

<sup>20</sup> Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. 

<sup>21</sup> But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; 

<sup>22</sup> Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: 

<sup>23</sup> For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; 

<sup>24</sup> Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: 

<sup>25</sup> Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; 

<sup>26</sup> To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. 

<sup>27</sup> Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. 

<sup>28</sup> Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. 

<sup>29</sup> Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: 

<sup>30</sup> Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. 

<sup>31</sup> Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.
