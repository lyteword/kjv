# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: 

<sup>2</sup> By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 

<sup>3</sup> And not only *so*, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; 

<sup>4</sup> And patience, experience; and experience, hope: 

<sup>5</sup> And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. 

<sup>6</sup> For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. 

<sup>7</sup> For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. 

<sup>8</sup> But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 

<sup>9</sup> Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. 

<sup>10</sup> For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. 

<sup>11</sup> And not only *so*, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. 

<sup>12</sup> Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: 

<sup>13</sup> (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. 

<sup>14</sup> Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come. 

<sup>15</sup> But not as the offence, so also *is* the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, *which is* by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. 

<sup>16</sup> And not as *it was* by one that sinned, *so is* the gift: for the judgment *was* by one to condemnation, but the free gift *is* of many offences unto justification. 

<sup>17</sup> For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) 

<sup>18</sup> Therefore as by the offence of one *judgment came* upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one *the free gift came* upon all men unto justification of life. 

<sup>19</sup> For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. 

<sup>20</sup> Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: 

<sup>21</sup> That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.
