# Romans 4 

**¹** What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found? 

**²** For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath *whereof* to glory; but not before God. 

**³** For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. 

**⁴** Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. 

**⁵** But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. 

**⁶** Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, 

**⁷** *Saying*, Blessed *are* they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. 

**⁸** Blessed *is* the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. 

**⁹** *Cometh* this blessedness then upon the circumcision *only*, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. 

**¹⁰** How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. 

**¹¹** And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which *he had yet* being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: 

**¹²** And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which *he had* being *yet* uncircumcised. 

**¹³** For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, *was* not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. 

**¹⁴** For if they which are of the law *be* heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect: 

**¹⁵** Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, *there is* no transgression. 

**¹⁶** Therefore *it is* of faith, that *it might be* by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, 

**¹⁷** (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, *even* God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. 

**¹⁸** Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be. 

**¹⁹** And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara’s womb: 

**²⁰** He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; 

**²¹** And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. 

**²²** And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. 

**²³** Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; 

**²⁴** But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; 

**²⁵** Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.
