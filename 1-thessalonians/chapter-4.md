# 1 Thessalonians 4 

**¹** Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort *you* by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, *so* ye would abound more and more. 

**²** For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus. 

**³** For this is the will of God, *even* your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication: 

**⁴** That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour; 

**⁵** Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God: 

**⁶** That no *man* go beyond and defraud his brother in *any* matter: because that the Lord *is* the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified. 

**⁷** For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness. 

**⁸** He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit. 

**⁹** But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another. 

**¹⁰** And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more; 

**¹¹** And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you; 

**¹²** That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and *that* ye may have lack of nothing. 

**¹³** But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. 

**¹⁴** For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. 

**¹⁵** For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive *and* remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. 

**¹⁶** For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: 

**¹⁷** Then we which are alive *and* remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 

**¹⁸** Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
