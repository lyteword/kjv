# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort *you* by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, *so* ye would abound more and more. 

<sup>2</sup> For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus. 

<sup>3</sup> For this is the will of God, *even* your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication: 

<sup>4</sup> That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour; 

<sup>5</sup> Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God: 

<sup>6</sup> That no *man* go beyond and defraud his brother in *any* matter: because that the Lord *is* the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified. 

<sup>7</sup> For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness. 

<sup>8</sup> He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit. 

<sup>9</sup> But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another. 

<sup>10</sup> And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more; 

<sup>11</sup> And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you; 

<sup>12</sup> That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and *that* ye may have lack of nothing. 

<sup>13</sup> But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. 

<sup>14</sup> For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. 

<sup>15</sup> For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive *and* remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. 

<sup>16</sup> For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: 

<sup>17</sup> Then we which are alive *and* remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 

<sup>18</sup> Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
