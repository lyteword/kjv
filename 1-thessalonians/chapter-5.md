# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. 

<sup>2</sup> For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. 

<sup>3</sup> For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. 

<sup>4</sup> But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. 

<sup>5</sup> Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. 

<sup>6</sup> Therefore let us not sleep, as *do* others; but let us watch and be sober. 

<sup>7</sup> For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. 

<sup>8</sup> But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. 

<sup>9</sup> For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, 

<sup>10</sup> Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. 

<sup>11</sup> Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do. 

<sup>12</sup> And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; 

<sup>13</sup> And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. *And* be at peace among yourselves. 

<sup>14</sup> Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all *men*. 

<sup>15</sup> See that none render evil for evil unto any *man*; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all *men*. 

<sup>16</sup> Rejoice evermore. 

<sup>17</sup> Pray without ceasing. 

<sup>18</sup> In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. 

<sup>19</sup> Quench not the Spirit. 

<sup>20</sup> Despise not prophesyings. 

<sup>21</sup> Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. 

<sup>22</sup> Abstain from all appearance of evil. 

<sup>23</sup> And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and *I pray God* your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

<sup>24</sup> Faithful *is* he that calleth you, who also will do *it.* 

<sup>25</sup> Brethren, pray for us. 

<sup>26</sup> Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss. 

<sup>27</sup> I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren. 

<sup>28</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ *be* with you. Amen.
