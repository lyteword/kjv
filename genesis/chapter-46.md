# Genesis 46 

**¹** And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac. 

**²** And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here *am* I. 

**³** And he said, I *am* God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: 

**⁴** I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up *again:* and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes. 

**⁵** And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 

**⁶** And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him: 

**⁷** His sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt. 

**⁸** ¶ And these *are* the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn. 

**⁹** And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi. 

**¹⁰** ¶ And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman. 

**¹¹** ¶ And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 

**¹²** ¶ And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zerah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul. 

**¹³** ¶ And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron. 

**¹⁴** ¶ And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel. 

**¹⁵** These *be* the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters *were* thirty and three. 

**¹⁶** ¶ And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli. 

**¹⁷** ¶ And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel. 

**¹⁸** These *are* the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, *even* sixteen souls. 

**¹⁹** The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife; Joseph, and Benjamin. 

**²⁰** ¶ And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him. 

**²¹** ¶ And the sons of Benjamin *were* Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard. 

**²²** These *are* the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls *were* fourteen. 

**²³** ¶ And the sons of Dan; Hushim. 

**²⁴** ¶ And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem. 

**²⁵** These *are* the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls *were* seven. 

**²⁶** All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, all the souls *were* threescore and six; 

**²⁷** And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, *were* two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, *were* threescore and ten. 

**²⁸** ¶ And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. 

**²⁹** And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. 

**³⁰** And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou *art* yet alive. 

**³¹** And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father’s house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father’s house, which *were* in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; 

**³²** And the men *are* shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have. 

**³³** And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What *is* your occupation? 

**³⁴** That ye shall say, Thy servants’ trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, *and* also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd *is* an abomination unto the Egyptians.
