# Genesis 21 

**¹** And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken. 

**²** For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. 

**³** And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. 

**⁴** And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him. 

**⁵** And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. 

**⁶** ¶ And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, *so that* all that hear will laugh with me. 

**⁷** And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born *him* a son in his old age. 

**⁸** And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the *same* day that Isaac was weaned. 

**⁹** ¶ And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking. 

**¹⁰** Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, *even* with Isaac. 

**¹¹** And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his son. 

**¹²** ¶ And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. 

**¹³** And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he *is* thy seed. 

**¹⁴** And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave *it* unto Hagar, putting *it* on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. 

**¹⁵** And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. 

**¹⁶** And she went, and sat her down over against *him* a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against *him*, and lift up her voice, and wept. 

**¹⁷** And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he *is*. 

**¹⁸** Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. 

**¹⁹** And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. 

**²⁰** And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. 

**²¹** And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt. 

**²²** ¶ And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God *is* with thee in all that thou doest: 

**²³** Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son: *but* according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. 

**²⁴** And Abraham said, I will swear. 

**²⁵** And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away. 

**²⁶** And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I *of it*, but to day. 

**²⁷** And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant. 

**²⁸** And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. 

**²⁹** And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What *mean* these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? 

**³⁰** And he said, For *these* seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well. 

**³¹** Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them. 

**³²** Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. 

**³³** ¶ And *Abraham* planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God. 

**³⁴** And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines’ land many days.
