# Chapter 6 

<sup>1</sup> And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,

<sup>2</sup> That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they *were* fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.

<sup>3</sup> And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also *is* flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.

<sup>4</sup> There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare *children* to them, the to them, the same *became* mighty mighty men which *were* of of old, men of renown.

<sup>5</sup> ¶ And GOD saw that the wickedness of man *was* great in the earth, and *that* every every imagination of the thoughts of his heart *was* only evil continually.

<sup>6</sup> And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.

<sup>7</sup> And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.

<sup>8</sup> But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.

<sup>9</sup> ¶ These *are* the the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man *and* perfect in his generations, *and* Noah walked with God.

<sup>10</sup> And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

<sup>11</sup> The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.

<sup>12</sup> And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.

<sup>13</sup> And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.

<sup>14</sup> ¶ Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

<sup>15</sup> And this *is the fashion* which thou shalt which thou shalt make it *of:* The The length of the ark *shall be* three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.

<sup>16</sup> A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; *with* lower, second, and third *stories* shalt thou shalt thou make it.

<sup>17</sup> And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein *is* the the breath of life, from under heaven; *and* every every thing that *is* in the in the earth shall die.

<sup>18</sup> But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives with thee.

<sup>19</sup> And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every *sort* shalt thou shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep *them* alive with thee; they shall be male and female.

<sup>20</sup> Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every *sort* shall shall come unto thee, to keep *them* alive.

<sup>21</sup> And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather *it* to thee; and it shall be for to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.

<sup>22</sup> Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
