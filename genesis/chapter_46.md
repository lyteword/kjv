# Chapter 46

<sup>1</sup> And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac. 

<sup>2</sup> And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I. 

<sup>3</sup> And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: 

<sup>4</sup> I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes. 

<sup>5</sup> And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 

<sup>6</sup> And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him: 

<sup>7</sup> His sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt. 

<sup>8</sup> ¶ And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn. 

<sup>9</sup> And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi. 

<sup>10</sup> ¶ And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman. 

<sup>11</sup> ¶ And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 

<sup>12</sup> ¶ And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zerah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul. 

<sup>13</sup> ¶ And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron. 

<sup>14</sup> ¶ And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel. 

<sup>15</sup> These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three. 

<sup>16</sup> ¶ And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli. 

<sup>17</sup> ¶ And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel. 

<sup>18</sup> These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls. 

<sup>19</sup> The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife; Joseph, and Benjamin. 

<sup>20</sup> ¶ And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him. 

<sup>21</sup> ¶ And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard. 

<sup>22</sup> These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen. 

<sup>23</sup> ¶ And the sons of Dan; Hushim. 

<sup>24</sup> ¶ And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem. 

<sup>25</sup> These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven. 

<sup>26</sup> All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, all the souls were threescore and six; 

<sup>27</sup> And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten. 

<sup>28</sup> ¶ And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. 

<sup>29</sup> And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. 

<sup>30</sup> And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive. 

<sup>31</sup> And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father’s house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father’s house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; 

<sup>32</sup> And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have. 

<sup>33</sup> And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation? 

<sup>34</sup> That ye shall say, Thy servants’ trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
