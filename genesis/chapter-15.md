# Chapter 15 

<sup>1</sup> After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I *am* thy thy shield, *and* thy thy exceeding great reward.

<sup>2</sup> And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house *is* this Eliezer of Damascus?

<sup>3</sup> And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.

<sup>4</sup> And, behold, the word of the LORD *came* unto him, unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.

<sup>5</sup> And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.

<sup>6</sup> And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.

<sup>7</sup> And he said unto him, I *am* the the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.

<sup>8</sup> And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?

<sup>9</sup> And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.

<sup>10</sup> And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.

<sup>11</sup> And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.

<sup>12</sup> And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.

<sup>13</sup> And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land *that is* not theirs, and shall not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;

<sup>14</sup> And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.

<sup>15</sup> And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.

<sup>16</sup> But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites *is* not not yet full.

<sup>17</sup> And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.

<sup>18</sup> In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:

<sup>19</sup> The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,

<sup>20</sup> And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,

<sup>21</sup> And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
