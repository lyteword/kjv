# Genesis 15 

**¹** After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I *am* thy shield, *and* thy exceeding great reward. 

**²** And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house *is* this Eliezer of Damascus? 

**³** And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir. 

**⁴** And, behold, the word of the LORD *came* unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. 

**⁵** And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. 

**⁶** And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness. 

**⁷** And he said unto him, I *am* the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it. 

**⁸** And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? 

**⁹** And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. 

**¹⁰** And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not. 

**¹¹** And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away. 

**¹²** And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him. 

**¹³** And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land *that is* not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; 

**¹⁴** And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance. 

**¹⁵** And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. 

**¹⁶** But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites *is* not yet full. 

**¹⁷** And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces. 

**¹⁸** In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates: 

**¹⁹** The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, 

**²⁰** And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims, 

**²¹** And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
