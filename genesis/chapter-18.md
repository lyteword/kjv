# Chapter 18 

<sup>1</sup> And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;

<sup>2</sup> And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw *them* , he, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,

<sup>3</sup> And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:

<sup>4</sup> Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:

<sup>5</sup> And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.

<sup>6</sup> And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead *it* , and, and make cakes upon the hearth.

<sup>7</sup> And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave *it* unto a young unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.

<sup>8</sup> And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set *it* before before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.

<sup>9</sup> ¶ And they said unto him, Where *is* Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.

<sup>10</sup> And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard *it* in the in the tent door, which *was* behind behind him.

<sup>11</sup> Now Abraham and Sarah *were* old *and* well well stricken in age; *and* it it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

<sup>12</sup> Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?

<sup>13</sup> And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?

<sup>14</sup> Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.

<sup>15</sup> Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.

<sup>16</sup> ¶ And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

<sup>17</sup> And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;

<sup>18</sup> Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?

<sup>19</sup> For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.

<sup>20</sup> And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;

<sup>21</sup> I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.

<sup>22</sup> And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.

<sup>23</sup> ¶ And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?

<sup>24</sup> Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that *are* therein?

<sup>25</sup> That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?

<sup>26</sup> And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

<sup>27</sup> And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which *am but* dust and ashes:

<sup>28</sup> Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for *lack of* five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy *it* ..

<sup>29</sup> And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do *it* for for forty’s sake.

<sup>30</sup> And he said *unto him* ,, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do *it* , if I, if I find thirty there.

<sup>31</sup> And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy *it* for for twenty’s sake.

<sup>32</sup> And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy *it* for for ten’s sake.

<sup>33</sup> And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.
