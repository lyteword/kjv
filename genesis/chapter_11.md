# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. 

<sup>2</sup> And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. 

<sup>3</sup> And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. 

<sup>4</sup> And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. 

<sup>5</sup> And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. 

<sup>6</sup> And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. 

<sup>7</sup> Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech. 

<sup>8</sup> So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. 

<sup>9</sup> Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> ¶ These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood: 

<sup>11</sup> And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. 

<sup>12</sup> And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: 

<sup>13</sup> And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. 

<sup>14</sup> And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 

<sup>15</sup> And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. 

<sup>16</sup> And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: 

<sup>17</sup> And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters. 

<sup>18</sup> And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: 

<sup>19</sup> And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters. 

<sup>20</sup> And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: 

<sup>21</sup> And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters. 

<sup>22</sup> And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: 

<sup>23</sup> And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. 

<sup>24</sup> And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 

<sup>25</sup> And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters. 

<sup>26</sup> And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. 

<sup>27</sup> ¶ Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. 

<sup>28</sup> And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. 

<sup>29</sup> And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. 

<sup>30</sup> But Sarai was barren; she had no child. 

<sup>31</sup> And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. 

<sup>32</sup> And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
