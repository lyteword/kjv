# Chapter 49 

<sup>1</sup> And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you *that* which shall which shall befall you in the last days.

<sup>2</sup> Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.

<sup>3</sup> ¶ Reuben, thou *art* my my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:

<sup>4</sup> Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed; then defiledst thou *it:* he went he went up to my couch.

<sup>5</sup> ¶ Simeon and Levi *are* brethren; instruments of cruelty *are in* their their habitations.

<sup>6</sup> O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.

<sup>7</sup> Cursed *be* their their anger, for *it was* fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.

<sup>8</sup> ¶ Judah, thou *art he* whom thy whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand *shall be* in the in the neck of thine enemies; thy father’s children shall bow down before thee.

<sup>9</sup> Judah *is* a a lion’s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?

<sup>10</sup> The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him *shall* the the gathering of the people *be* ..

<sup>11</sup> Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:

<sup>12</sup> His eyes *shall be* red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.

<sup>13</sup> ¶ Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he *shall be* for an for an haven of ships; and his border *shall be* unto unto Zidon.

<sup>14</sup> ¶ Issachar *is* a a strong ass couching down between two burdens:

<sup>15</sup> And he saw that rest *was* good, and the land that *it was* pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.

<sup>16</sup> ¶ Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

<sup>17</sup> Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.

<sup>18</sup> I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.

<sup>19</sup> ¶ Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.

<sup>20</sup> ¶ Out of Asher his bread *shall be* fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.

<sup>21</sup> ¶ Naphtali *is* a a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.

<sup>22</sup> ¶ Joseph *is* a a fruitful bough, *even* a a fruitful bough by a well; *whose* branches run over the wall:

<sup>23</sup> The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot *at him* , and hated, and hated him:

<sup>24</sup> But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty *God* of of Jacob; (from thence *is* the the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)

<sup>25</sup> *Even* by the by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:

<sup>26</sup> The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.

<sup>27</sup> ¶ Benjamin shall ravin *as* a a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.

<sup>28</sup> ¶ All these *are* the the twelve tribes of Israel: and this *is it* that their that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.

<sup>29</sup> And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that *is* in the in the field of Ephron the Hittite,

<sup>30</sup> In the cave that *is* in the in the field of Machpelah, which *is* before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.

<sup>31</sup> There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.

<sup>32</sup> The purchase of the field and of the cave that *is* therein therein *was* from the from the children of Heth.

<sup>33</sup> And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.
