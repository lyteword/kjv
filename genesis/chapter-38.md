# Genesis 38 

**¹** And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name *was* Hirah. 

**²** And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name *was* Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her. 

**³** And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er. 

**⁴** And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan. 

**⁵** And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him. 

**⁶** And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name *was* Tamar. 

**⁷** And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him. 

**⁸** And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother. 

**⁹** And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled *it* on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother. 

**¹⁰** And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also. 

**¹¹** Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren *did*. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house. 

**¹²** ¶ And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 

**¹³** And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep. 

**¹⁴** And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which *is* by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife. 

**¹⁵** When Judah saw her, he thought her *to be* an harlot; because she had covered her face. 

**¹⁶** And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she *was* his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me? 

**¹⁷** And he said, I will send *thee* a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give *me* a pledge, till thou send *it*? 

**¹⁸** And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that *is* in thine hand. And he gave *it* her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him. 

**¹⁹** And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. 

**²⁰** And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive *his* pledge from the woman’s hand: but he found her not. 

**²¹** Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where *is* the harlot, that *was* openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this *place*. 

**²²** And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, *that* there was no harlot in this *place*. 

**²³** And Judah said, Let her take *it* to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her. 

**²⁴** ¶ And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she *is* with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. 

**²⁵** When she *was* brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these *are, am* I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose *are* these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff. 

**²⁶** And Judah acknowledged *them*, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more. 

**²⁷** ¶ And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins *were* in her womb. 

**²⁸** And it came to pass, when she travailed, that *the one* put out *his* hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first. 

**²⁹** And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? *this* breach *be* upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez. 

**³⁰** And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.
