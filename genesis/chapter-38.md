# Chapter 38 

<sup>1</sup> And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name *was* Hirah.

<sup>2</sup> And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name *was* Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.

<sup>3</sup> And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.

<sup>4</sup> And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.

<sup>5</sup> And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.

<sup>6</sup> And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name *was* Tamar.

<sup>7</sup> And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.

<sup>8</sup> And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.

<sup>9</sup> And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled *it* on the on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.

<sup>10</sup> And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.

<sup>11</sup> Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren *did* . And. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.

<sup>12</sup> ¶ And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.

<sup>13</sup> And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.

<sup>14</sup> And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which *is* by the by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.

<sup>15</sup> When Judah saw her, he thought her *to be* an an harlot; because she had covered her face.

<sup>16</sup> And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she *was* his daughter in his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?

<sup>17</sup> And he said, I will send *thee* a a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give *me* a a pledge, till thou send *it* ??

<sup>18</sup> And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that *is* in thine in thine hand. And he gave *it* her, and came her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.

<sup>19</sup> And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.

<sup>20</sup> And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive *his* pledge from the woman’s hand: but he found her not.

<sup>21</sup> Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where *is* the the harlot, that *was* openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this *place* ..

<sup>22</sup> And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, *that* there was no there was no harlot in this *place* ..

<sup>23</sup> And Judah said, Let her take *it* to her, lest we be to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.

<sup>24</sup> ¶ And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she *is* with with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.

<sup>25</sup> When she *was* brought brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these *are, am* I with I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose *are* these, the these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.

<sup>26</sup> And Judah acknowledged *them* , and, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.

<sup>27</sup> ¶ And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins *were* in her in her womb.

<sup>28</sup> And it came to pass, when she travailed, that *the one* put put out *his* hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.

<sup>29</sup> And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? *this* breach *be* upon thee: therefore his upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.

<sup>30</sup> And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.
