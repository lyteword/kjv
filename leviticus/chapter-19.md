# Leviticus 19 

**¹** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

**²** Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God *am* holy. 

**³** ¶ Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I *am* the LORD your God. 

**⁴** ¶ Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I *am* the LORD your God. 

**⁵** ¶ And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will. 

**⁶** It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire. 

**⁷** And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it *is* abominable; it shall not be accepted. 

**⁸** Therefore *every one* that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 

**⁹** ¶ And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest. 

**¹⁰** And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather *every* grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I *am* the LORD your God. 

**¹¹** ¶ Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another. 

**¹²** ¶ And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I *am* the LORD. 

**¹³** ¶ Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob *him:* the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning. 

**¹⁴** ¶ Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I *am* the LORD. 

**¹⁵** ¶ Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: *but* in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour. 

**¹⁶** ¶ Thou shalt not go up and down *as* a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I *am* the LORD. 

**¹⁷** ¶ Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him. 

**¹⁸** ¶ Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I *am* the LORD. 

**¹⁹** ¶ Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee. 

**²⁰** ¶ And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that *is* a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free. 

**²¹** And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, *even* a ram for a trespass offering. 

**²²** And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him. 

**²³** ¶ And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of. 

**²⁴** But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD *withal*. 

**²⁵** And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I *am* the LORD your God. 

**²⁶** ¶ Ye shall not eat *any thing* with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times. 

**²⁷** Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard. 

**²⁸** Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I *am* the LORD. 

**²⁹** ¶ Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness. 

**³⁰** ¶ Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I *am* the LORD. 

**³¹** ¶ Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I *am* the LORD your God. 

**³²** ¶ Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I *am* the LORD. 

**³³** ¶ And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him. 

**³⁴** *But* the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I *am* the LORD your God. 

**³⁵** ¶ Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure. 

**³⁶** Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I *am* the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt. 

**³⁷** Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I *am* the LORD.
