# Chapter 26

<sup>1</sup> Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God. 

<sup>2</sup> ¶ Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD. 

<sup>3</sup> ¶ If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them; 

<sup>4</sup> Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. 

<sup>5</sup> And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. 

<sup>6</sup> And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. 

<sup>7</sup> And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. 

<sup>8</sup> And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. 

<sup>9</sup> For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you. 

<sup>10</sup> And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new. 

<sup>11</sup> And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you. 

<sup>12</sup> And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people. 

<sup>13</sup> I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright. 

<sup>14</sup> ¶ But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments; 

<sup>15</sup> And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant: 

<sup>16</sup> I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. 

<sup>17</sup> And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. 

<sup>18</sup> And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins. 

<sup>19</sup> And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass: 

<sup>20</sup> And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits. 

<sup>21</sup> ¶ And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. 

<sup>22</sup> I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate. 

<sup>23</sup> And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me; 

<sup>24</sup> Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins. 

<sup>25</sup> And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. 

<sup>26</sup> And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. 

<sup>27</sup> And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me; 

<sup>28</sup> Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins. 

<sup>29</sup> And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. 

<sup>30</sup> And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you. 

<sup>31</sup> And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours. 

<sup>32</sup> And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it. 

<sup>33</sup> And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. 

<sup>34</sup> Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies’ land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths. 

<sup>35</sup> As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. 

<sup>36</sup> And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. 

<sup>37</sup> And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies. 

<sup>38</sup> And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. 

<sup>39</sup> And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them. 

<sup>40</sup> If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me; 

<sup>41</sup> And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity: 

<sup>42</sup> Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. 

<sup>43</sup> The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes. 

<sup>44</sup> And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God. 

<sup>45</sup> But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD. 

<sup>46</sup> These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
