# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them, 

<sup>2</sup> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These *are* the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that *are* on the earth. 

<sup>3</sup> Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, *and* cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat. 

<sup>4</sup> Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: *as* the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he *is* unclean unto you. 

<sup>5</sup> And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he *is* unclean unto you. 

<sup>6</sup> And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he *is* unclean unto you. 

<sup>7</sup> And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he *is* unclean to you. 

<sup>8</sup> Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they *are* unclean to you. 

<sup>9</sup> ¶ These shall ye eat of all that *are* in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat. 

<sup>10</sup> And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which *is* in the waters, they *shall be* an abomination unto you: 

<sup>11</sup> They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination. 

<sup>12</sup> Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that *shall be* an abomination unto you. 

<sup>13</sup> ¶ And these *are they which* ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they *are* an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray, 

<sup>14</sup> And the vulture, and the kite after his kind; 

<sup>15</sup> Every raven after his kind; 

<sup>16</sup> And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, 

<sup>17</sup> And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl, 

<sup>18</sup> And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle, 

<sup>19</sup> And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat. 

<sup>20</sup> All fowls that creep, going upon *all* four, *shall be* an abomination unto you. 

<sup>21</sup> Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon *all* four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth; 

<sup>22</sup> *Even* these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind. 

<sup>23</sup> But all *other* flying creeping things, which have four feet, *shall be* an abomination unto you. 

<sup>24</sup> And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even. 

<sup>25</sup> And whosoever beareth *ought* of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. 

<sup>26</sup> *The carcases* of every beast which divideth the hoof, and *is* not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, *are* unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean. 

<sup>27</sup> And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on *all* four, those *are* unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even. 

<sup>28</sup> And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they *are* unclean unto you. 

<sup>29</sup> ¶ These also *shall be* unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind, 

<sup>30</sup> And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole. 

<sup>31</sup> These *are* unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even. 

<sup>32</sup> And upon whatsoever *any* of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether *it be* any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel *it be*, wherein *any* work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed. 

<sup>33</sup> And every earthen vessel, whereinto *any* of them falleth, whatsoever *is* in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it. 

<sup>34</sup> Of all meat which may be eaten, *that* on which *such* water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every *such* vessel shall be unclean. 

<sup>35</sup> And every *thing* whereupon *any part* of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; *whether it be* oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: *for* they *are* unclean, and shall be unclean unto you. 

<sup>36</sup> Nevertheless a fountain or pit, *wherein there is* plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean. 

<sup>37</sup> And if *any part* of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it *shall be* clean. 

<sup>38</sup> But if *any* water be put upon the seed, and *any part* of their carcase fall thereon, it *shall be* unclean unto you. 

<sup>39</sup> And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even. 

<sup>40</sup> And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. 

<sup>41</sup> And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth *shall be* an abomination; it shall not be eaten. 

<sup>42</sup> Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon *all* four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they *are* an abomination. 

<sup>43</sup> Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby. 

<sup>44</sup> For I *am* the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I *am* holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 

<sup>45</sup> For I *am* the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I *am* holy. 

<sup>46</sup> This *is* the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth: 

<sup>47</sup> To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.
