# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) 

<sup>2</sup> And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: 

<sup>3</sup> Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, 

<sup>4</sup> Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father: 

<sup>5</sup> To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 

<sup>6</sup> I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 

<sup>7</sup> Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. 

<sup>8</sup> But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. 

<sup>9</sup> As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. 

<sup>10</sup> For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. 

<sup>11</sup> But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. 

<sup>12</sup> For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. 

<sup>13</sup> For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: 

<sup>14</sup> And profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. 

<sup>15</sup> But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace, 

<sup>16</sup> To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: 

<sup>17</sup> Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus. 

<sup>18</sup> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. 

<sup>19</sup> But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother. 

<sup>20</sup> Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. 

<sup>21</sup> Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; 

<sup>22</sup> And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ: 

<sup>23</sup> But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. 

<sup>24</sup> And they glorified God in me.
