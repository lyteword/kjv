# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. 

<sup>2</sup> Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. 

<sup>3</sup> For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. 

<sup>4</sup> But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. 

<sup>5</sup> For every man shall bear his own burden. 

<sup>6</sup> Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. 

<sup>7</sup> Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. 

<sup>8</sup> For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he tha t soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. 

<sup>9</sup> And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. 

<sup>10</sup> As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all *men*, especially unto them who are of the household of faith. 

<sup>11</sup> Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand. 

<sup>12</sup> As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. 

<sup>13</sup> For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. 

<sup>14</sup> But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. 

<sup>15</sup> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. 

<sup>16</sup> And as many as walk according to this rule, peace *be* on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. 

<sup>17</sup> From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. 

<sup>18</sup> Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ *be* with your spirit. Amen.
