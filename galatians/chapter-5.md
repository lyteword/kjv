# Galatians 5 

**¹** Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. 

**²** Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. 

**³** For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. 

**⁴** Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. 

**⁵** For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. 

**⁶** For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. 

**⁷** Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? 

**⁸** This persuasion *cometh* not of him that calleth you. 

**⁹** A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. 

**¹⁰** I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be. 

**¹¹** And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased. 

**¹²** I would they were even cut off which trouble you. 

**¹³** For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only *use* not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. 

**¹⁴** For all the law is fulfilled in one word, *even* in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 

**¹⁵** But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. 

**¹⁶** *This* I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. 

**¹⁷** For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. 

**¹⁸** But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. 

**¹⁹** Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are *these*; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, 

**²⁰** Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, 

**²¹** Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told *you* in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. 

**²²** But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 

**²³** Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. 

**²⁴** And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. 

**²⁵** If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. 

**²⁶** Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
